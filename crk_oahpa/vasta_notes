done

 * settings.py settings for eng FSTs 
 * install eng lexicon
 * added --language setting for install process, with very quick hack
   for ling.py

TODO

 * check conflict with crk? ling.py needs to look at some language attr to select the right
   analyzer
 * filter paradigms into individual eng_ pos files?
 
 * enable in UI
