done

 * settings.py settings for eng FSTs 
 * install eng lexicon
 * added --language setting for install process, with very quick hack
   for ling.py
 * question format requires
    <questions game="vasta">

 * Pron_crk contains pos="Dem", needed to be "Pron"

 * proper nouns need to be installed and generated (added to
   N_Prop_eng.xml) so that forms generate with <eng> and questions can
   find them

 * small fixes to cealkka so that it won't break if a question has no
   answers installed

 * add some ENG_ settings in settings.py

{{{
    ENG_FST_DIRECTORY = '../crk/englexc/'
    ENG_DIALECTS = {
        'main': ('../crk/englexc/ieng.fst', 'Unrestricted'),
    }

    ENG_HLOOKUP_TOOL = '/usr/local/bin/lookup'
    ENG_LOOKUP_TOOL = '/usr/local/bin/lookup -flags mbTT'
}}}


TODO

 * all eng tags? do these conflict with crk at all?

 * enable in UI
