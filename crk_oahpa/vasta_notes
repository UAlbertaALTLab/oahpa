done

 * settings.py settings for eng FSTs 
 * install eng lexicon
 * added --language setting for install process, with very quick hack
   for ling.py
 * question format requires
    <questions game="vasta">

 * Pron_crk contains pos="Dem", needed to be "Pron"

 * proper nouns need to be installed and generated (added to
   N_Prop_eng.xml) so that forms generate with <eng> and questions can
   find them

 * small fixes to cealkka so that it won't break if a question has no
   answers installed

TODO

 * all eng tags? do these conflict with crk at all?
 * troubleshoot install problems beginning with vadji1

 * check conflict with crk? ling.py needs to look at some language attr to select the right
   analyzer
 * filter paradigms into individual eng_ pos files?
 
 * enable in UI
