Otherwise I have tried to use words that are used as headwords in MiP or otherwise appear fairly early in that book. This set of distinctions follows Zaliznjak very closely and thus should match up with the disambiguation-generation tools that Francis has made.There are some nouns that decline like adjectives and have to get a different message, such as ва́нная, моро́женое, шампа́нское, учёный (this item not on our list), ру́сский.	“This noun has the same endings as an adjective.”There are also some masculine animate nouns that end in -a/-я that have to get a different message, such as де́душка, дя́дя, па́па.	For дедушка, папа:	“This noun is masculine, but looks like a hard stem feminine animate noun. It has the same endings as ма́ма.”	For дя́дя:	“This noun is masculine, but looks like a soft stem feminine animate noun. It has the same endings as герои́ня.” Note that this particular noun will also get the special feature message about GPl -ей.There will be some common-gender nouns like (у́мница, ро́хля, сирота́, брю́зга, левша́). None of these items are on our MiP list.	“This noun can be masculine or feminine, but looks like a feminine ... animate noun... It has the same endings as...”There are some indeclinable nouns like метро́, интервью́, пальто́, би́стро.	“This noun is does not change its form.”There are some plural-only nouns like лы́жи, молодожёны, де́ньги. But maybe this is not a problem and they do not need any message.There are some idiоsyncratic nouns like дочь, мать, муж, сосед, брат, друг.	“This is an irregular noun.”2) Stress	Here I have arranged the messages according to the Zaliznjak stress codes, which are given to the left of each message. The user will need to understand that if the pattern calls for end stress in a form that has no ending, the stress falls on the last syllable of the stem.	a	“This noun always has stress on the stem.”		b	“This noun always has stress on the ending.”	b'	“This noun has stress on the ending in all forms except the ISg.”		c	“This noun has stress on the stem in the singular and on the ending in the plural.”		d	“This noun has stress on the ending in the singular and on the stem in the plural.”	d'	“This noun has stress on the ending in the singular, but on the stem in the ASg and the plural.”	e	“This noun has stress on the stem in the singular and NPl and APl, but has stress on the ending in the other plural forms.” [inanimate nouns]	e	“This noun has stress on the stem in the singular and NPl, but has stress on the ending in the other plural forms.” [animate nouns]	f	“This noun has stress on the ending in all forms except the NPl.”	f'	“This noun has stress on the ending in all forms except the ASg and NPl.”	f''	“This noun has stress on the ending in all forms except the ISg and the NPl.”3) Special features	This will be a collection of special problems and exceptions. The most obvious one is mobile vowels. We can add more as needed.Mobile vowels	“This noun has a mobile vowel.”Special endings	“This noun has GPl -ей.” e.g., дя́дя	“This noun has no GPl form.”  e.g., мечта́	“This noun has a second locative form.” e.g., лес	“This noun has a second genitive form.” e.g., чай**********************Example of how this would work:	The user is prompted to provide the NPl for не́мец.	The user puts in не́меци.	The system detects an error and gives this message to the user:		This is a masculine animate noun ending in -ц. It has the same endings as оте́ц.		This noun always has stress on the stem.		This noun has a mobile vowel.
