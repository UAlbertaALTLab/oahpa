    <title>OAHPA! Vocabulary</title>
  </header>

  <body>
<p>We have collected words in text books, and we have added some everyday words, such as words for food dishes, clothes, school words. In the OAHPA! vocabulary we have colleted the words from thee following textbooks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Davvin 1-4</li>
<li>Sárá ja su ustibat</li>
<li>Bures, bures fas</li>
<li>Oaidnalit</li>
<li>Universitetet i Tromsøs SAM-0010 kompendium</li>
<li>Kåfjord Samisk språksenters Álgu-kurs-kompendium</li>
</ul>

<p>The vocabulary is marked with textbook, part of speech and topic. The user can choose to work with words from a specific topic or textbook, in e.g. word quizes or grammar exercises. </p>

<p>We may also make exercises on topics not included in our textbooks, e.g. on Sámi handicraft. Contact us if you have wishes or suggestions! (oahpa@hum.uit.no) </p>

<p>The vocabualry is used actively in our games, quizes, etc., but in the dialogues and analysis tools the user may use more words. The program then uses a lexicon with appr. 100.000 words (among them appr. 40.000 names).</p>
