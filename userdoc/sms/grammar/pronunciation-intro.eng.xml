<p> Back to the <a href="grammar.eng.html">grammar's main page</a>. </p>

<p>On the page <a href="alphabet.eng.html">Alphabet</a> you find a list with all Skolt
Sámi letters. For each letter you can also listen to the general pronounciation. On the following
pages, the pronunciation of each letter for <a href="pronunciation-vowel.eng.html">vowels</a>, <a
href="pronunciation-consonant.eng.html">consonants</a> and other <a
href="pronunciation-sign.eng.html">letter-like signs</a> is explained with the help of example words
you can listen to. </p>

<p>We are also writing a small <a href="../lesson-intro.eng.html">textbok</a> which is linked to
pages with <a href="../exercise-intro.eng.html">exercises</a>, among other thinks. </p>

<p>Remember that some letters in Skolt Sámi have a different pronunciation from English.
Furthermore there are several letters which English does not have. Apart from that, Skolt Sámi orthography
is relatively close to the actual pronunciation. Therefore, only in a few cases we need to use a
kind of simplyfied transkription. These are the forms written in between two slashes / … /. This
transcription shall only give you an impression about the general pronunciation of the respective
letter, but does not show the actual Skolt Sámi orthography! </p>

<p>Our materials comply with the orthography which is official in Finland. This orthography is also
used in Norway and Russia today. </p>

<p>Please note that our explanations are written for people without special knowledge in phonology.
We compare the Skolt Sámi pronunciation with Norwegian and Russian and in some cases with other languages in
order to create easily comprehensible explanations. Better phonological descriptions you will find in the
following sources: </p>

<li>Korhonen, M. / Mosnikoff / Sammallahti, P. 1973: <em>Koltansaamen opas</em>. Helsinki</li>

<p>Remember that stress normally falls on the first syllable in Skolt Sámi, just like in other Sámi languages or in Finnish. </p>
