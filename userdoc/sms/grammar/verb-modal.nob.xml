    <section>
      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>There is a small group of verbs which is called <em class="focus">modal auxiliaries</em> or
          <em class="focus">modal help verbs</em>. These verbs can alter the verbal meaning in a
        sentence. Compare the English sentence:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>She sings.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It can be modified by several modal verbs, for example:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>She can sing.</li>
        <li>She must sing.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The information given about the subject in the sentence is changed: either you get the
        information that the subject sings, that the subject is able to sing or that the subject
        needs to sing.</p>
      <p>Modal auxiliaries have a wide variety of meanings, mainly referring to possibility or
        necessity. Like other verbs, modal auxiliaries inflect for person <!--link to inflexion-->
        (first, second, third and a fourth – indefinite – person), number (singular and plural),
        tense (non-past and past) and mood (indicative, potential and conditional). Unlike other
        verbs, however, it is neither possible to use a passive <!--link to derivation--> or
        imperative form.</p>
      <p>16 verbs can be used as modal auxiliaries. Their different meanings will be described in
        the following sections.</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Negated modal auxiliaries</title>
      <p>All modal verbs can also be used in a negative sense (regularly combined with the verb of
        negation <!--link-->), but there is one modal auxiliary that is <em class="focus">only</em>
        used with a <em class="focus">negative meaning</em>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em class="lg_mat">iǥõl</em> 'not allowed to' (possibility and necessity) <ul>
            <li><em class="lg_mat">Leâš-a leʹjje teʹl pââʹzztemsluuʹžvpoodd, de teʹl iǥõl
                siõrrâd.</em></li>
            <li>But there were church service times of fasting, and then one was not allowed to
              play.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Specialities</title>
      <p>There are only a few irregularieties or special rules to be taken care of by using modal
        auxiliaries. For instance the verb <em class="lg_mat">feʹrttjed</em> 'must, be obliged to'
        requires that the subject occur in the locative case while the verb itself only occurs in
        the third person singular:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em class="lg_mat">??feʹrttai??</em></li>
        <!-- (Feist: 243) -->
        <li>??</li>
      </ul>
      <!--<p>As shown in the examples above, the general meaning of modal verb constructions is to show
        that the subject of the sentence has the ability, wish, admission, liability, possibility or
        necessity to do something. All verbs listed above are used accordingly. However, there is
        one modal verb <em class="lg_mat">täi´dded</em> 'seem, may', which can only be used as a
        suggestion or allegation about the subject in a sentence, like in English:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>She may sing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here it is not sure wether or not the subject is going to sing.</p>
      <p>For the verbs <em class="lg_mat">mäʹtted</em> 'must', <em class="lg_mat">vââʹjjed</em>
        'may', <em class="lg_mat">äppšed</em>, <em class="lg_mat">suiʹtted</em> and <em
          class="lg_mat">säʹtted</em> 'may' you can find an overlap between these two usages.</p>-->
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Other</title>
      <p>As you have seen in the examples above, the modal auxiliary is normally followed by the
        main verb. The main verb is in the infinitive, whereas the modal verb is inflected.</p>
      <!--Note, however
        that a complex construction with the modal auxiliary in the infinitive is also possible ??subjunctive??:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em class="lg_mat">Kâʹl tättad leʹjjem, jiõččan nõõm leʹjjem ǩeeʹrjted, leâš-a jiõm
            huõllâm.</em></li>
        <li>Yes, I would have wanted (to be able to read Finnish), I would have written my own name,
          but I didn't bother.</li>
      </ul>-->
