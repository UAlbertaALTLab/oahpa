      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Derivation is a process with which you can easily expand your vocabulary. By taking
        adjectives, nouns or verbs and combining them with certain suffixes you can create new verbs
        with a meaning affiliated to that of the original word. Take te adjective <em class="lg_mat"
          >xxx</em> 'xxx' as an example: By adding a suffix we can form the xxx verb <em
          class="lg_mat">xxx</em> 'xxx'.</p>

      <p>The derived verbs are declined in infinite or finite forms, just as other verbs are. The
        inflectional endings are added after the derivational suffix.</p>

      <title>Deverbal verbs</title>
      <p>We will start by explaining how to form new verbs out of already existing ones. By doing
        this, you can achieve a slight change in meaning. To make it clearer, let us have a look at
        the example verb <em class="lg_mat">xxx</em> 'xxx'. With the help of derivational suffixes
        we can create new verbs which are in some way connected to the original word:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em class="lg_mat">xxx</em> 'xxx'</li>
        <li><em class="lg_mat">xxx</em> 'xxx'</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Note that some derivational suffixes are attached to the strong, other to the weak
        consonant stem of a verb.</p>

    <p>These were the most important and mostly used endings and rules for verb derivation in Skolt
      Sámi. They can help you form new verbs out of already existing words.</p>
