    <p>Word quizes are fun, and useful in order to train the vocabulary. The Leksa game is meant for pupils who are learning Sámi, perhaps also for pupils in need of writing practice. The program accepts synonyms, so that "то̄лл" can be translated as both "ild" and "bål". Let us know if synonyms are missing!</p>
    
    <p><strong>Options</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>From Sami to Finnish <!--Norwegian or Finnish-->, or from Finnish <!--Norwegian or Finnish--> to Sami.</li>
<li>Words: You can restrict the vocabulary, and choose a text book or a subject.</li>
<li>If you choose "Multi-word expression" in the menu, you must write at least two Sami words, e.g. "kärŋilis tääsi"</li>

<!--
<li>Names: You may choose between place names and person names.
Place names: You can restrict the geographical range of the place names ("Sápmi" or "World"). You can also restrict the place names according to frequency ("common" or "rare").
</li>
-->
</ul>

<p>In Leksa, we want the users to practice everyday language, and the game is based on words which are used in beginner courses, with additions from primary school textbooks. You can read more about this on the Oahpa-vocabulary page. We can add lists of place names from your area, and we can also make teaching aids for specific subjects, such as sami handicraft (duodji). Feel free to contact us if you have suggestions.</p>
