    <title>Leksa - not quite ready yet</title>
  </header>

  <body>
    <p>Word quizes are fun, and useful in order to train the vocabulary. The Leksa game is meant for pupils about to learn Sámi, perhaps also for pupils in need of writing practice. Animal-Quiz suits pupils who already have reached an advanced level.</p>
    
    <p>Parts of our resources are beta versions. This means that there may be errors in them. Feel free to send us corrections and suggestions for improvement! (oahpa@hum.uit.no) </p>
