    <title>Vasta - now ready for testing</title>
  </header>

  <body>
    
    <p>With Vasta program you are supposed to give answes to random questions. The purpose of the exercise is to train verb inflection and case usage. The program will accept several answer alternatives, and give comments to deviating inflection or case usage. The program has 3 levels - level 1 offers only simple questions, - for example questions in present tense only. The highest level will  among other things require you to inflect numerals in case.</p>

    <p>The program requires full sentence answers, containing a finite verb. If the program asks using the pronoun "we", you are supposed to answer with "you", not with (inclusive) "we", and the same goes for the dual forms. The goal, again, is not to simulate natural conversation ("should we go now? - Yes, we should"), but to train all subject-verb combinations, rather than repeating input. </p>
 
    <p>Grammar explanations to the user are not ready yet, but they are forthcoming.</p>
    

<p>The program is still at beta stage. At this stage all the comments from the program will be given in Norwegian, but we are soon going to implement SÃ¡mi as a meta language as well. We would like to receive comments and feedback, to the address: (oahpa@hum.uit.no). </p>
