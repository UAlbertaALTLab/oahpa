Here starts the documentation for making Morfa work for new languages. The goal is to make a demo of Morfa-C with 2-3 sentence matrices and the lemmas from Leksa. <a href="http://oahpa.uit.no/"><strong>Here</strong></a> you can see how the North Sámi Morfa-S and Morfa-C work. Choose instruction language in the right margin before you choose the program.

			<title>Question-answer-pair matrix for Morfa-C</title>
<p>Now starts the fun part of the work. With help of the semantic classes in the lexicon you can make tasks for the pupils. What kind of tasks depends on the language. Your tools are the semantic sets of HUMAN nouns, HUMAN adjectives, PLACE nouns, MOVEMENT verbs, ATIVITY verbs, FOOD nouns and DRINK nouns.</p>


<p>The matrix contains both variables and constants. This is an example of a question-answer-pair matrix in North Sami. The first text is "What did SUBJ yesterday?", the next one is "Yesterday SUBJ MAINV". The line with game="morfa" implies that the task for the pupil is to write the correct word form of the MAINV.</p>
		<source>
   &lt;q id="prtSg">
    &lt;qtype>PRT&lt;/qtype>
    &lt;question>
      &lt;text>Maid ADJ SUBJ barggai ikte&lt;/text> 
      &lt;element id="ADJ">
	&lt;sem class="HUMAN"/>
	&lt;grammar tag="A+Attr"/>
      &lt;/element>
     &lt;element id="SUBJ">
	&lt;sem class="HUMAN"/>
	&lt;grammar tag="N+Sg+Nom"/>
      &lt;/element>
    &lt;/question>
    &lt;answer> 
      &lt;text>Ikte SUBJ MAINV&lt;/text> 
      &lt;element game='morfa' id="MAINV" task="yes">
	&lt;grammar tag="V+Ind+Prt+Sg3"/>
	&lt;sem class="ACTIVITY"/>
      &lt;/element>
    &lt;/answer> 
  &lt;/q>	
  
 </source>

<p>This first matrix generate tasks like "What did the old teacher yesterday?" "bake" "Yesterday the teacher ____ " . As you see, the variable ADJ is just for giving variation. The qtype is PRT: to inflect verbs in past tense. It will be useful when you have made so many matrices that you will sort them as options for the pupil. But we will not use it in the demo. Every matix has an id to make it easier to remove them.</p><p> One example with inflecting nouns:</p>

		<source>
   &lt;q id="AdjPred">
    &lt;qtype>PRED&lt;/qtype>
    &lt;question>
      &lt;text>Makkárat SUBJ leat&lt;/text>
      &lt;element id="ADJ">
	&lt;sem class="HUMAN"/>
	&lt;grammar tag="A+Attr"/>
      &lt;/element>
     &lt;element id="SUBJ">
	&lt;sem class="HUMAN"/>
	&lt;grammar tag="N+Pl+Nom"/>
      &lt;/element>
    &lt;/question>
    &lt;answer> 
      &lt;text>Sii leat ADJ&lt;/text>
      &lt;element game='morfa' id="ADJ" task="yes">
	&lt;grammar tag="A+Pl+Nom"/>
	&lt;sem class="HUMAN"/>
      &lt;/element>
    &lt;/answer> 
  &lt;/q>		
  </source>
<p>The first text is "What kind are the SUBJ?", the next one is "They are ADJ". The line with game="morfa" implies that the task for the pupil is to write the correct word form of the ADJ. This matrix will generate tasks like "What kind are the girls?" "clever" "They are ______ (plural form in North Sami) ". </p><p> One more example:</p>
		<source>
  &lt;q id="nill">
    &lt;qtype>N-ILL&lt;/qtype>
    &lt;question>
      &lt;text>Gosa SUBJ MAINV&lt;/text> 
      &lt;element id="SUBJ">
	&lt;grammar pos="N+Sg+Nom"/>
	&lt;sem class="HUMAN"/>
      &lt;/element>
      &lt;element id="MAINV">
	&lt;grammar tag="V+Ind+Tense+Sg3"/>
	&lt;sem class="MOVEMENT"/>
      &lt;/element>
    &lt;/question>
    &lt;answer> 
      &lt;text>SUBJ MAINV N-ILL&lt;/text>
      &lt;element game='morfa' id="N-ILL" task="yes">
	&lt;grammar tag="N+Sg+Ill"/>
	&lt;sem class="PLACE"/>
      &lt;/element>
    &lt;/answer>
  &lt;/q>
	
  </source>
<p>The first text is "Where does SUBJ MAINV?", the next one is ""SUBJ MAINV N-ILL". The line with game="morfa" implies that the task for the pupil is to write the correct word form of the N-ILL. This matrix will generate tasks like "Where does the girl run?" "school" "The girl runs ______ (illative case in Sami) " . </p>

<p>For the demo we do it simply. E.g. we don't use pronouns in the answer, which in principle is easy, but then we have to take in account that in some languages there are genders. We have also an agreement fuction e.g. between SUBJ and MAINV which one could use.</p>

			<title>Word forms</title>
<p>In the lexicon are only lemmas. The Morfa-C tasks need word forms. There are two ways of doing it - the best one is to generate the needed word forms automatically. If you can't do it for your language, then you have to write the word forms manually. The work depends on the matrices, there you see which word forms you need for each lemma, also the basis forms. The word forms have to be in this format (tab-separated): </p>
  <source> 
  wordformTABlemma+POS+.......
  
  bargat    bargat+V+Ind+Inf
  barggan   bargat+V+Ind+Prs+Sg1
  bargen   bargat+V+Ind+Prt+Sg1
  viessu    viessu+N+Sg+Nom
  viesut    viessu+N+Pl+Nom
  viesus    viessu+N+Sg+Loc
  boaris    boaris+A+Sg+Nom
  boarrásat boaris+A+Pl+N
  </source>	
  <p>Save them in a file with the language code, e.g. smewordforms.txt</p>	
		</section>

		<section>
			<title>Morfa-S</title>
<p>Morfa-S is made of the file of word forms. You have to decide what options there should be, take a look at the North Sami Morfa-S. This will be a big work if you cannot generate the word forms automatically.</p>
