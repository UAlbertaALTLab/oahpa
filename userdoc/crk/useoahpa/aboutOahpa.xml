    <title>A set of language learning programs for Plains Cree</title>
  </header>

    <p><a href="http://testing.oahpa.no/crk_oahpa/">Oahpa</a> is a learner's aid for acquisition of languages with complex grammar, like Plains Cree. It is developed by University of Tromsø, and used by students learning Saami languages. The source code it free and open, and the programs can be made in other languages also, and adjusted to the actual needs. This first Cree demo is made of University of Tromsø, in collaboration with AltLab at UofA, but further work will be done of AltLab at UofA in collaboration with those teachers, who want to use the programs for their students.</p> 
<p>The programs make tasks for the students, and they can be integrated in course materials, like we have done for North and South Saami, e.g. <a href="http://kursa.oahpa.no">North Saami Language courses for students</a>. The programs have many choices and therefore can be adapted to the students' level and needs. Still it is not so appropriate for young children, because it is based on written language.</p>

<p>Here is a brief introduction to each of the programs which are included in the Plains Cree demo: </p>
<p><strong>Numra</strong>: practice numbers, dates, clock and money. Practice from number to word, or from word to number. Examples:</p> 
<ul>
<li>nîstanaw nistosâp = 23</li>
<li>nîstanaw cipahikanis pâmayes nisto tipahikan = 10:20</li>
<li>5 ehakimiht opiniyâwewowipîsimohk = 5th of May</li>
<li>nîso newopehikanak mînâpihtaw = $2.50</li>
</ul>
<p>The program can accept several answers, like for $2.50, it will also accept: 'nîso newopehikanak nîyânanomitanaw pîwâpiskos' and 'nîso newopehikanak nîso sônîyâs'.</p> 
    <p><img alt="Leksa" width="300" class="align-right" src="../../images/crkleksaaudio.png"/></p>

<p><strong>Leksa</strong> - practice with words, from Cree to English/French, or from English/French to Cree. It is possible to add more languages, e.g. another First Nations language. </p>
<p>In Leksa one can include audio files. In the demo there are audio files for some of the words: Choose audio files in the book menu. The programs will accept synonyms which are added to the program.</p>
<p><strong>Morfa S</strong> - inflection of nouns and verbs, individual words</p>
<p><strong>Morfa C</strong> - inflection of nouns and verbs in context (question + answer)</p>
    <p><img alt="Morfa" width="300" class="align-right" src="../../images/crkmorfac.png"/></p>

<p>Be aware of that the demo is only a start, a fully developed program will include much more tasks. The tasks should be made in collaboration with teachers. The teacher can give links to the students which include the relevant settings. </p> 
<p>The student can limit the vocabulary to what is given in the textbooks or the curriculum. In Leksa-program s/he can choose semantic field instead of book.</p>
<p>For all programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>The student can try as many times as s/he wants, before s/he asks for the key</li>
<li>The student can ask for hints, and then try again (not implemented yet)</li>
<li>There will be links to grammar explanations (not written yet)</li>
<li>One can let the programs accept answers without macrons</li>
<li>The tasks are generated from programs, which make thousands of different tasks</li>
<li>It is possible to make to program in two versions, one for each alphabet: Romans and syllables</li>
<li>It is possible to adapt the program to varieties (dialects, different spelling conventions), and make a menu for it.</li>
<li>In a fully developed program, there can be a 'login'. The teacher can log in and see which tasks the students have been working with, and the students can follow their own progression compared to the curriculum.</li>
</ul>


<p>The name Oahpa is a North Saami word for: Learn! This name and the names of each program can be changed to names, which sound better for the Cree students.</p> 
<p>The idea behind the programs, is that if the students can practice grammar alone, and still get immediate response to their work, then the teacher can spend more of the time in the class to practice other parts of the language skills. </p>
