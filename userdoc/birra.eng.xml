    <title>About the pedagogical project</title>
  </header>

  <body>
    <p>The project is financed by the Norwegian Sámi Parliament (405.000 NOK) and the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Tromsø. The work was initiated during the summer of 2007, and it is scheduled to be ready at the end of 2008.</p>
    <p>The project has two main goals:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Build programs so that students and pupils may practice their communicative Sámi skills</li>
    <li>Ráhkadit interaktiivalaš spealuid sámegillii.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Min mielas lea lunddolaš prošektii čatnat maid eará heivvolaš resurssaid maid Romssa Universitehta Giellatekno lea ráhkadan. Dan dihte leat ráhkadeamen OAHPA!-portála.</p>

<title>Interactive practice of communication skills</title> 
    <p>The core idea of the project is to use automatic word and sentence analysis, in order to build programs that, together with the user, may interact in dialogues on everyday topics. The program may be an important addititon to pupils and students studing Sámi, but also to parents and others with some knowledge of Sámi, but with a feeling that the knowledge needs improvement. They will be able to practice the use of Sámi, and at the same time get some guidance. The program will be available on the internet, free for use for all.</p>

<p>The program also contains a lexicon with appr 100.000 words, among them appr. 40.000 names. The name lexicon makes it possible to build exercises where pupils may learn names and how to use them.</p>

<title>Interactive grammar games</title> 

<p>In order to train grammar we have analysed a set of Sámi sentences and  interaktiivalaš spealuid sámegillii dainna ahte heiveha davvisámi cealkagiid ja integrere daid <code>VISL</code> Visual Interactive Syntax Learning-prográmmaide. Spealuiguin olmmoš hárjehallá dovdat sátneluohkáid ja čoavdit cealkagiid. VISL ráhkaduvvui álgoálggus dánska studeanttaid várás, muhto lea dán áigge geavahusas vuođđo- ja joatkkaskuvllain sihke Dánmárkkus ja Norggas. </p>

<title>Taget group</title> 

<p>The target group consists of students and plurals, but also e.g. the pupils' parents. Internet access is available in most homes, thus parents may, either alone or together with the children, train their Sámi skills by the help of the games or chatting with the program. The user himself choses the topic, the program builds a dialogue on the basis of the topic, and the user's responses. The program evaluates verb declension and case usage, and tells the user what s/he eventually has done wrong. Prográmma sáhttá maid áddestaddat albma gulahallama danne go vástádus muhtun muddui váikkuha čuovvovaš jearaldahkii. Jus geavaheaddji omd. vástida ahte sus lea beana, de son sáhttá oažžut jearaldagaid beatnaga birra.

<title>The linguistic background</title> 

<p><strong>The language technology group at the UiT</strong> has since the year 2000 made analysis programs for a.o. North Sámi, programs with which it is possible to analyse and build wordforms for Sámi text, and resolve contextual disambuities.</p>

<p><strong>The project workers are:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Lene Antonsen, pedagog and linguist</li> 
<li>Biret Ánne Bals, linguista</li> 
<li>Saara Huhmarniemi, programmer</li>
<li>Kjellaug Isaksen, graphical desigmer</li>
<li>Trond Trosterud, computational linguist</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The VISL group at Syd-Dansk Universitet in Odense</strong> uses the same computational tools as we do (finite-state transducers and constraint grammar), and with them they have build a whole suite of pedagogical programs for using the analysed texts in different ways. In this way it is possible to add new languages to the same framework, by basically adding analysed texts to a ready-made framwork. The VISL pages now contain pedagogical games for almost 30 different languages.</p>
