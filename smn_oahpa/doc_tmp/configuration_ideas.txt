To add a new question type to Morfa-S I need to edit the following files, often doing things that are repeated across multiple places
 * smadrill/game.py 
 * smadrill/views.py 
 * smadrill/forms.py

Altering the case menu for pronouns in a separate instance required editing the following: 
 * smadrill/game.py
 * smadrill/views.py
 * smadrill/forms.py
 * smadrill/templates/mgame_p.html

A future Oahpa should ideally define all question types for Morfa, Leksa and the rest of the games in a configuration file which also contains information on how the database is installed, and what the data sources are.

For ease of configuration, I'd recommend YAML, because the idea is that if Oahpa becomes much more user-friendly to those who want to maintain their own Oahpa for their own language, setting it up shouldn't require a ton of custom coding. Of course, we can assume that they'll be generating with HFST or something like that ;) 

Example of YAML follows, you'll get the idea...

Config:
 leksa: True
 morfa_s: True
 numra: False # Numra is disabled

Languages:
  "sma": "Southern Sámi"
  "nob": "Norwegian (bokmål)"
  "swe": "Swedish"

Leksa:
  pairs:
    "sma-nob"
	"nob-sma"
	"sma-swe"
	"swe-sma"
  semsets:
	"HUMAN"
	"HUMAN_DOING"
	# etc... 
  sources:
	"åa1": "Etc..."

Morfa:
  language: "sma"
  
  question_types:
	case:
      "ILL": "N+Sg+Ill", "N+Pl+Ill" # This is assumed to be tags
      "INE": "N+Sg+Ine", "N+Pl+Ine"
	stem:
	  "bisyllabic": "2syll" # Need some way of defining where this data comes from, of course
	  "trisyllabic": "3syll"
  
  display_dialect:
	"SH": "Etc..."
	"L": "Etc..."
