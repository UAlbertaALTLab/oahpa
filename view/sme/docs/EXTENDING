Creating a New Topic/Activity in WERTi
======================================

Creating a new topic is a little complicated.  First off, the terminology 
can potentially be confusing, so to clarify:

- topic: the grammar topic being presented, e.g., determiners

- activity: the type of presentation, e.g., colorize, click, multiple 
  choice, practice

Unfortunately, we haven't always used these names correctly in the 
directory structure, but we'll try to use them consistently in the 
instructions below.

It's easiest to start out with a copy of an existing topic and modify it 
gradually.  In the first section, we'll start out by modifying a copy of 
the Determiners topic that annotates prepositions instead of determiners.  
This involves adding a new topic to the web interface and firefox add-on, 
but doesn't yet involve new annotators.  The second section will discuss 
how to add new annotators and the third section will discuss how to modify 
the activities.


The Simplest New Topic
----------------------

We're going to make a copy of the determiners topic and modify it to 
highlight prepositions instead.

1. Make a copy of the topic specification

Make a copy of the Dets directory in 'src/main/webapp/activities/Dets 
called 'src/main/webapp/activities/Preps'.

(Yes, this directory should actually be called "topics" to line up with 
the terminology above.)

2. Edit 'src/main/webapp/activities/Preps/activity.xml'

Change the <name> of the topic to "Prepositions".

Modify the following line so that the tag under consideration is IN 
instead of DT.

    <entry key="Tags" value="IN" overridable="yes"/>

(Note: IN probably isn't quite sufficient for a prepositions activity, but 
that's not important for this explanation.  The TokenEnhancer can also 
annotate more that one tag if you provide a comma-separated list like 
"JJ,JJR,JJS".)

3. Edit 'src/main/webapp/activities/Preps/help.jsp for the new topic.  
(This step can easily be postponed, but don't forget it!)

4. Create a new topic in the WERTi firefox extension

4a. Add the new topic to the WERTi toolbar

Edit 
'src/main/resources/firefox-extension/werti/chrome/content/browser.xul' to 
add a new item to the werticore-toolbar-topic-menu menu:

    <menuitem id="werticore-toolbar-topic-Preps" label="&prepositions;" value="Preps" />

Add the string for &prepositions; to 
'src/main/resources/firefox-extension/werti/locale/en-US/translations.dtd'.

4b. Add the javascript implementing the activities for the new topic to 
the extension

Our example new topic 'Preps' is similar enough to 'Dets' that several 
shortcuts can be taken.  Option 1 describes these shortcuts.  Option 2 
describes the steps for a completely new topic.

Option 1: The 'Preps' topic is extremely similar to the 'Dets' topic, so 
it's possible to use most of the same code from pos.js.  Add the case 
'Preps' to the switch(topic) statements in 
'src/main/resources/firefox-extension/werti/chrome/content/pos.js' with 
new CSS class names and add the colorize styles to 
'src/main/resources/firefox-extension/werti/chrome/content/werticore.css'.

Search in werti.util.HTMLEnhancer and in 
'src/main/resources/firefox-extension/werti/chrome/content/activity.js' 
for the places where 'Dets' is translated to 'pos' and add 'Preps' to 
this set of special cases.

Option 2: If the new topic is not as similar, add a new class to handle 
the activities for the new topic:
 
Copy 'src/main/resources/firefox-extension/werti/chrome/content/pos.js' 
to 'src/main/resources/firefox-extension/werti/chrome/content/preps.js'.  
The name of the new class should be the lowercase version of the directory 
name chosen in step #1.

Edit 'preps.js' to change the class name to werticore.preps (in line 2)

    werticore.preps = {

Add the colorize styles to 
'src/main/resources/firefox-extension/werti/chrome/content/werticore.css'.

In 'preps.js', change all occurrences of 'werticore.pos' to 
'werticore.preps'.

Edit 
'src/main/resources/firefox-extension/werti/chrome/content/browser.xul' to 
tell the add-on to load this new class (around line 12):

    <script type="application/x-javascript" src="chrome://werticore/content/preps.js" />

Add preps.js to the list of files automatically copied to the web form 
interface javascript directory in 'pom.xml' under:

    <plugin>
        <groupId>com.google.code.maven-replacer-plugin</groupId>
        ....
            <filesToInclude>blur.js,pos.js,jquery-1.4.2.min.js,lib.js,notification.js,werticore.css</filesToInclude>

See 'Modifying Activities' below for more information on the structure of 
the activities classes.

(Note: this automatic copying, which saves a lot of hassle in keeping the 
extension and web interface in sync, causes eclipse to throw "Resource 
out of sync" errors every time the servlet is refreshes/restarted.  This 
is really annoying, but I haven't found a better solution.  If you find 
one, let me know!)

5. Try it out

Refresh/redeploy to be sure the javascript and CSS files from the 
extension directory have been copied to the web interface directory and 
that the most recent version of the add-on has been generated in 
'src/main/webapp/firefox-extension'.

Try out the new activity in the web form interface

    http://localhost:8080/WERTiCore/index.jsp?content=activity-help&activity=Preps

Install the latest version of the add-on from

    http://localhost:8080/WERTiCore/index.jsp?content=firefox-extension
    
and see if it works.

6. Troubleshooting

6a. Server errors

Look for details about server errors in the tomcat logs.  The default 
location is /path/to/tomcat/logs/werti.log.  If you develop WERTi in 
eclipse, logging information and errors are printed to the console.

6b. Firefox extension errors

Debugging a firefox extension takes a little effort.  Here are some tips 
on how to set up your profile and your environment to make this easier:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en/setting_up_extension_development_environment

The error console (in the Tools menu) shows details about most kinds of 
errors if you've set up your environment as explained in the previous 
link.  Firebug can also help you figure out if something has gone wrong 
when adding the enhancements to the page.


Adding New Annotators and Enhancers
-----------------------------------

If you add a new topic that annotates something other than parts of 
speech, you'll need to add new annotators and enhancers that are used in a 
UIMA pipeline to annotate the relevant grammatical features.

Both annotators and enhancers are annotators from UIMA's perspective.  In 
WERTi, annotators add linguistic annotation and enhancers interpret the 
linguistic annotation to generate the HTML annotation that will be 
inserted into the enhanced page.

This section will point out where the relevant files are in WERTi, but 
isn't intended to be a UIMA tutorial.  A UIMA tutorial can be found here:

    http://uima.apache.org/doc-uima-annotator.html

1. If you need to annotate new features on existing types of annotation or 
add new types of annotation, modify or add new type descriptions in 
'desc/WERTiTypeSystem.xml'. (Remember that you'll need to refresh the 
project in eclipse after doing this so that it sees the new type files 
generated by JCasGen.)

2. Add your analysis engine descriptions to 'desc/annotators/' for 
annotators and to 'desc/enhancers/' for enhancers.  Operators that 
describe an annotator pipeline for a topic are in 'desc/operators/'.

3. Add the corresponding annotator and enhancer implementations to 
'src/main/java/werti/uima/ae/' and 'src/main/java/werti/uima/enhancer/'.

Models can be loaded in an annotator's initialize() method, but to 
improve response times and memory usage, the class werti.WERTiContext was 
designed to load all models once and store them in memory for future use.  
The models are loaded the first time a request is sent to the server (not 
immediately when the server is restarted as you might expect), so the 
first time you load a page after restarting the server it will be slow, 
but any subsequent requests will be much faster.

4. The activity.xml for your new topic will specify one of the operators 
as the preprocessor and one of the enhancers as the postprocessor.


Modifying Activities
--------------------

The activities are written in javascript using the jQuery library.  The 
class of each topic (e.g., pos.js) contains the following functions:

remove()       removes annotation and event listeners for all activity 
               types
colorize()     colorizing for the web form interface
colorizeSpan() colorizing for the add-on interface (this separate function 
               improves efficiency for the add-on)
click()        sets up the click activity
clickHandler() listens for click events and responds appropriately
mc()           sets up the multiple choice activity
cloze()        sets up the practice activity
clozeInputHandler()  listens for text typed in the input boxes or selections
                     in drop-down menus
clozeHintHandler()   listens for click events on the hint buttons

In the demo determiners topic, the multiple choice activity is extremely 
similar to the cloze activity, so the multiple choice activity can use the 
cloze event listeners without any modifications, but this depends of 
course on what the multiple choice activity should do.

It is important for remove() to remove all annotation and event listeners 
for all possible activities.  If remove() misses any markup or event 
listeners, unpredictable things can happen when a page is enhanced 
multiple times without reloading.  Currently, all WERTi markup is 
surrounded by <span class="werticore"> tags, so it's easy to replace 
these spans with their original text-only content.  For the mc() and 
cloze() activities, the original text content is stored in a hidden 
variable using jQuery.data(), so that it's easy to access when the markup 
should be removed.

In order to get around problems with WERTi activities inside links, links 
are disabled for the purposes of certain activities and reenabled when the 
markup is removed.  This is controlled in addActivity() in 'activity.js'.

If you want to add a new activity type beyond colorize/click/etc., you 
will need to add the activity in the menu in 'browser.xul' and modify 
'activity.js' so that it calls the right function in addActivity().

If you leave out one of the functions, say you haven't implemented cloze() 
yet for a new topic, WERTi will detect that the function doesn't exist and 
show an error message asking the learner to select another activity.

When you've finished implementing a new activity, remember to edit 
'src/main/webapp/tmpl/form.jsp' to add the new activity type to the web 
form interface.
