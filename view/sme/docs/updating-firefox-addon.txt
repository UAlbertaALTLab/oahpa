Before running mccoy for the first time, copy the WERTi mccoy profile to 
your own .mozilla directory.  

- on delos: cp -rp ~adriane/.mozilla/mccoy to ~/.mozilla/mccoy

For each new version:

1. Create the new .xpi file (double-check that you have all the right version 
   numbers in install.rdf).
2. Edit update.rdf.dev:
   Copy the previous <r:li> block and update the version number, the
   min/max firefox versions as needed, update the download link, and add 
   the sha256sum of the new .xpi file.
3. Copy update.rdf.dev to update.rdf.  (mccoy destroys the formatting, so it's
   a lot easier to edit update.rdf.dev and let mccoy reformat update.rdf as it
   desires.)
4. Run ~adriane/mccoy/mccoy (currently on delos) and enter the password in 
   ~adriane/mccoy/view-key.txt
5. Select WERTi Extension.
6. Click on "Sign" and select the updated update.rdf file.
7. When you click "Open", update.rdf will be updated in place and mccoy won't 
   display any further information.
