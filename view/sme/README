WERTi: a Platform for ICALL Systems
===================================

WERTi is an intelligent computer-assisted language learning (ICALL) system 
designed to provide supplementary language learning activities using 
authentic English texts selected by the learner.  It can be viewed as an 
intelligent automatic workbook, providing an unlimited number of 
activities designed to foster awareness of English grammatical forms and 
functions.

The WERTiCore package provides the core WERTi functionality including:

- java servlet that performs linguistic annotation and HTML enhancement
- firefox extension that sends requests to the servlet and enhances web 
  pages
- web site that provides help pages and a browser-independent web form
  interface that can enhance a web page given its URL

For demonstration purposes, WERTiCore includes a determiners topic that 
enhances any tokens tagged with DT by an OpenNLP pipeline that includes 
the OpenNLP tokenizer, sentence detector, and tagger.
