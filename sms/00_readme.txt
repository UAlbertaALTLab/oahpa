This directory contains material relevant to Oahpa!-nu천rti. The  dictionary database (in /src) is imported from a "common" dictionary database called (~/sms2X).

=====
State of the art:

Currently, our preliminary version of Oahpa!-nu천rti includes one "book", which is actually not a schoolbook, but just a list of basic vocabulary:
* book="100" (~100 words)
Tagging of semantic fields for these words is also only preliminary.

=====
Current plans:

The next version of Oahpa!-nu천rti, currently in the works, will include all entries tagged with:
* book="200" (~200 words)
This is still only a list of basic vocabulary, but it will already be useful for teaching beginners. Tagging of semantic fields for these words will also be improved.

=====
Future plans:

The planned next version of Oahpa!-nu천rti (to be compiled in intermediate steps) will include all entries tagged with:
* book="kurss" (schoolbook in Finnish, Russian and Norwegian versions, see the Norwegian version here: http://omnibus.uni-freiburg.de/~mr5496/downl/Kurss_nob.pdf)
* book="termm" - different term(inological) lists, which are not completely included in the textbook or the basic vocabulary lists.

=====
CG (old note):
For Opahpa-update, only entries with book=200 be use:
sms2X>grep '<e ' _spittOutCorpus/*.xml | wc -l
     269

_spittOutCorpus>grep '<e ' *.xml | cut -d ':' -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
 102 n_sms2X.xml
  76 v_sms2X.xml
  48 a_sms2X.xml
  16 adv_sms2X.xml
  13 pro_sms2X.xml
   7 con_sms2X.xml
   5 num_sms2X.xml
   1 ord_sms2X.xml
   1 adp_sms2X.xml

A further point to take into accout:

_200-book_entry>grep '<e ' *.xml | wc -l
     269
_200-book_entry>grep '<mg' *.xml | wc -l
     306

 ==> tansform mg-dict-format into mg-oahpa-format:
     i.e., one entry per mg!

CG: sms db update 20130114:

src>comm -12 new_sms-db.txt old_sms-db.txt | wc -l
      51
src>comm -23 new_sms-db.txt old_sms-db.txt | wc -l
     218
src>comm -13 new_sms-db.txt old_sms-db.txt | wc -l
      47
Ergo: There are 47 entries in the old db that are not covered by the new one.
    ==> merging the two dbs.
