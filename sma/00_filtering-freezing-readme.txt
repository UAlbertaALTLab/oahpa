This file contains the current work with filtering and freezing of
smanob files stemming from the dict directory.
It is aimed to ease the communication between Cip, Lene and Trond, the reason
is that the 00_readme.txt file was meant for the steady filtering and reverting files.

File locations:

1. smaX (X=nob, X=swe)
 - for the Røros team, Lene and Cip: gtsvn/ped/sma/src
 - for Cip, Lene and Ryan: pedversions/smaoahpa/data_sma/sma (this will be changed etter hvert!)

2. Xsma:
 - for the Røros team, Lene and Cip: gtsvn/ped/sma/Xsma
 - for Cip, Lene and Ryan: pedversions/smaoahpa/data_sma/X (this will be changed etter hvert!)

File status:

1. smaX 
1.a. in gtsvn/ped/sma/src:


1.b. in pedversions/smaoahpa/data_sma/sma:


2. Xsma 
2.a. in gtsvn/ped/sma/src:


2.b. in pedversions/smaoahpa/data_sma/X:

File synchronization until we will have only ONE place to work with them (i.e., also for Ryan!):
1. file to be reverted for Xsma:

 person in charge of that: Ciprian

2. non-revertable file:

 person in charge of that: Lene
