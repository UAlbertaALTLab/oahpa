##  Agreement definitions
 #

# Each item in Agreements contains the following keys:
#     name, elements, agreements.
#
# `elements` is a list of elements which participate in agreement each item in
# element must contain the key element and tag, where element corresponds to
# the MorfaC element name, and tag corresponds to a pattern that the tag must
# match.

# Here is where it is slightly tricky. In order for agreement to work, one part
# of the tag will be used to determine what the part of the other tag in the
# relationship will be, thus one must determine an agreement head, which may
# not correspond to linguistic theory surrounding what heads of agreement are,
# however in this case, head shall be defined as a word form with a tag that we
# know, and agreeing elements will match this tag.

# Thus, one of the elements must be marked as 'head', by inserting the
# key-value pair head: True. This element will be obligatory in order for the
# agreement to occur, and many other agreeing items may be listed that are not
# heads. On the elements that agree, the part of the tag that is determined
# based on features of the head must be replaced with AGR.

# Once these items are defined, the `agreements` key must be specified. It
# contain a list of key-value pairs listing what parts of the tag must
# correspond.

#     elements: 
#       - element: "P-REC"
#         tag: "Pron+Recipr+Acc+AGR"
#         head: True
#       - element: "REC"
#         tag: "Pron+Recipr+AGR+Nom"
#     agreements:
#       - "P-REC": "PxDu1"
#         "REC": "Du"
#       - "P-REC": "PxPl1"
#         "REC": "Pl"

# Thus what this means is that P-REC is the head, and the part of the tag with
# AGR will match up with the AGR in the element REC. Furthermore, the kinds of
# matches that will occur are defined in `agreements`. If P-REC contains PxDu1,
# then AGR in REC will be substituted with Du, and so on. The match only checks
# for substrings within the tag, nothing more complicated at the moment.

# Reference to membership in Question and Answer may also be included
