<!--From design.html: The system gives feedback about spelling errors and grammatical errors. See the section speller for spelling errors. Whenever a grammatical error is detected, a feedback window and the tutorial section are activated. The feedback may be more fine-grained than the tutorial. One suggestion for the format is described below.  -->
<!--From design.html: The tutorial section consists of longer sections of text that describe certain grammatical phenomena. They are attached only to grammatical errors (since we don't have any mechanism to detect the type of spelling error). Each type of grammatical error has its own tutorial section, which can be opened when an error is encountered. -->
