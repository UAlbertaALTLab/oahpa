# Database installation

I'm sure the process is similar to other oahpas, but it never hurts to take notes!

1. Backup logs (not going to delete them, but just in case)

	- python manage.py dumpdata smadrill.log > logs.json
	
	OR

	- python manage.py printlogs > logs.txt

2. Update svn in data_sma/

	- svn up data_sma/

3. Recompile FSTs

	- cd gtsvn/gt/
	- cat ../../../compiling_fsts.txt | bash

	* Note, it is not necessary to run the notes in the documentation, but follow them (this is just a shortcut)


4. Clear smadrill data minus logs

	- python manage.py sqlclear smadrill | grep -v '_log' | python2.6 manage.py dbshell

5. Sync the database to recreate the destroyed tables

	- python manage.py syncdb

6. Run the database installation script

	- ./parafedaba.sh

... And keep an eye on the output. When it's done, error.log will contain the errors from the installation process. You can also less +F error.log to watch while the process runs.
