    This is a chunk of angularjs (see courses.js), which
    simply displays the user's current course status. It is
    a simple HTTP GET request, and the part below is the
    template snippet.

    Here's the sample results key from the JSON, in case
    more is required in the template.
    {
        "results": [
            {
                "progress": "0.89", 
                "rounds": 1, 
                "total_answered": 9, 
                "correct": 8, 
                "completed_date": null, 
                "grade": null
            }
        ]
    }

    TODO: hide with css manually until we know that JS request works

    NB: template tags here are <% %>. Typically it's a bad idea to mix
    templating things, client/server-wise, but this is so minimal and
    for the purposes of display only, so it shouldn't provide problems.
