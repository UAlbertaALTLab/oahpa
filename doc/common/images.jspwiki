!!!Images
Preferably in jpg-format. Collect the images and scale them to size,
where width of the image is 150-180px (perhaps we should decide which
size). Height of the picture can be anything. Internet Exporer
requires this size, the other browsers will work regardless of the
size of the image.

Store the images to directory ped/oahpa/media/img/, with the same name
as they are specified in the dialoguefile.xml. In dialoguefile.xml,
use only the name of the image, not the full path.

If you are installing a new game, update the file
ped/oahpa/drill/templates/sahka.html. The file contains a table where
all the images are stored as links to new dialogues:

{{{
<td>
<a href="javascript:submitSahka('firstmeeting_man');">
<img width="100" src="/oahpa/media/man.jpg"/>
<p>{% trans "Meeting with Hansa" %}</p></a>
</td>
}}}

Copy one such td, to a suitable place inside the table, specify a
width to the image that fits to the page. Remember to change the name
of the file, and finally, add the name of the dialogue to the javascript
section. In the example above the dialogue name is "firstmeeting_man."
