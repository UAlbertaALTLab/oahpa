!!!Mysql 

In general, the database does not have to be directly accessed, but
sometimes it is necessary. The database tables created by Django may
be updated, removed and so on using mysql directly. The name of the
database is oahpa, username and password are available from .. 

Sometimes, there may be a problem with the mysqld (a clear indication
of a problem is that the games are not working at all). It may be that
mysqld has stopped working. Start it again:
{{{
sudo /etc/init.d/mysqld start
}}}


!!! Dump and import

In order to dump the database into a format that can be imported directly into
another mysql database server: 

{{{
mysqldump --compatible=ansi --single-transaction --add-drop-table --set-charset -u USERNAME DATABASENAME -p > database_dump.sql
}}}

You will be prompted for the user's password, and the dump will begin. By
default, the dump is produced in stdout, thus it's good to pipe the output to a
file.

In order to skip a few steps, another possibility is to execute the command via
SSH and pipe the results directly into a database, _overwriting_ the contents.

{{{
ssh user@hostname "mysqldump --compatible=ansi --other-options-etc" | python manage.py dbshell
}}}

You may be prompted for both the password to the source database, and the
password to the target database, so it can be a good idea to test the parts of
the process to see. In any case, this provides the means to quickly copy the
database between servers via a secure protocol, and with no storage of
temporary files which would contain sensitive data, such as passwords.
