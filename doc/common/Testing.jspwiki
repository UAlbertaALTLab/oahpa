We need regular testing, and the testing should be documented.

__Important:__ Always test Oahpa online after you have done any of the following:

# installed something into the database (words, questions, feedback messages)
# made changes into the templates (.html-files)
# made changes into the Python (.py) files

In case of (3), you have to restart the web server (httpd on victorio, fastcgi on gtoahpa and gtlab) to see the effect of the changes.
