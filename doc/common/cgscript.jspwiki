!!!CG-script


In order to make it run:

Copy the file oahpa/sme/src/sme-ped.cg3 to /opt/smi/sme/bin on victorio.

There is a Makefile in oahpa/sme/src as well, it compiles sme-ped.cg3.bin.

The {{.bin}} file is dependent upon being compiled with a {{vislcg3}} compiler not
older than the vislcg3 that runs it. Therefore, we do not use the .bin 
file, but rather the {{.cg3}} file.

The command for calling the cg3 file is found in {{oahpa/drill/forms.py}}.
