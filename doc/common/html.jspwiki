!!!HTML

!!Overall look

* CSS-settings reside in {{ped/oahpa/media/css/oahpa.css}}
* Mainpage __oahpa.no__ is defined in
  {{ped/oahpa/drill/templates/oahpa_main.html}}
* Basic look for all the games (divs, menubars) are given in file
  {{ped/oahpa/templates/oahpa.html}}
* The file game.html contains the basic functionality for all the games.
* Morhpology games are controlled by the file {{mgame.html}}

In addition, it is possible to alter the pages of individual games by
editing the files

{{{
ped/oahpa/drill/templates/mgame_n.html (Morfa for nouns)
ped/oahpa/drill/templates/mgame_l.html (Morfa numerals)
ped/oahpa/drill/templates/mgame_a.html (Morfa for adjectives)
ped/oahpa/drill/templates/mgame_v.html (Morfa for verbs)
ped/oahpa/drill/templates/quizz.html (Leksa common nouns)
ped/oahpa/drill/templates/quizz_n.html (Leksa placenames)
ped/oahpa/drill/templates/num.html (Numra cardinal)
ped/oahpa/drill/templates/num_ord.html (Numra ordinals)
ped/oahpa/drill/templates/vasta.html
ped/oahpa/drill/templates/sahka.html
}}}

Game pages involve definitions from several html-pages. For example, S-MORFA: mgame_x.html, mgame.html, game.html and oahpa.html. 

The files contain template tags such as:

{{{
{% block navbar %}
..
{% endblock %}
}}}

They enable several pages to be generated from one source file. In
addition, some variables are inside double braces. However, the rest
of the page is plain html and it may be edited as any html-file. If there is an error you may always return to the previous svn-version. Remember to test.

!!Examples

If you want to update a text in English, write inside the trans-tags in the html-file for the main page or the game :

{{{
{% trans ".." %}
}}}

To make a new box for option xxx in Leksa Placenames under geography choices, you have to add this to the files:

{{{
1. oahpa/drill/forms.py: 
GEOGRAPHY_CHOICES =  ('xxx', _('xxx')), 
and     # For placename quizz
    xxx = forms.BooleanField(required=False,initial=0)


2. oahpa/drill/views.py:         
if 'xxx' in settings_form.data:
            self.settings['geography'].append('xxx')

3. oahpa/drill/templates/quizz_n.html: 
{{ settingsform.xxx }}{% trans "xxx" %}<br/>

}}}
