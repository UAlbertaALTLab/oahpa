Install first the feedback messages, preferably for all languages:
{{{
python install.py -m ../sme/xml/messages.xml
python install.py -m ../sme/xml/messages.sme.xml
}}}
After that, install the feedback files for each pos. This may take
some time, even hours, especially for nouns and adjectives.
{{{
python install.py -e ../sme/xml/feedback_verbs.xml -f ../sme/xml/verbs.xml
..
}}}

You may update the content of the feedback messages, or add new
languages without installing the feedback again. However, new feedback
messages as well as new ids require reinstallation of the releveant
feedback files. Vice versa, changes in the feedback file do not
require reinstallation of the messages.

* There is also a good amount of information in forms.py
