!!!Lookup server

The lookup-process for the analyzer {{ped-sme.fst}}, used in Vasta
and Sahka, is running all the time. The lookup is implemented as a
server, callable by different processes. When started, it reads the file
{{/opt/smi/sme/bin/ped-sme.fst}} and provides analyses based on exactly this fst. 

The lookupserv calls a lookupserv.py files in the {{sme/bin}} catalogue in opt.

__NB:__ Any update of the FST requires a restart of the lookup server!

* __(re-)starting__ the server:
** go to the {{src}} folder in the {{ped}} folder of the running oapha production folder (you will find the lookupserv document there)
** type the command {{sudo ./lookupserv restart}}
* __testing__ the server using the commad-line tool, that takes one word at a time:
** go to {{/home/oahpa/ped/src}}
** type the command {{sudo python client.py}}
* __checking__ the log file for the lookup output from Sahka and Vasta on victorio:
** inspect the file {{/var/log/lserv.log}} with you editor of choice
