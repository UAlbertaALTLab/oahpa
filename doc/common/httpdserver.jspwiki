!!!Restarting the httpd server

Updates to the code require restart of the httpd-server. Sometimes
updates to the localisation require that too. The restart is otherwise
harmless, but may distrub someone who is playing the came (although
that is not very probable).

Restarting the server (requires sudo rights):
{{{
sudo /etc/init.d/httpd restart
}}}


Earlier, there was a memory leak problem, which should not be among us
anymore. However if victorio is very slow, check the memory by writing:
{{{ps aux | grep http}}}

If the result indicates memory use too close to 100, this is a clear
problem indication. The answer is to restart the apache web server,
and thereafter, if need, to [restart mysqld|Mysql.html].

If the webserver takes too much memory, ou may also want to stop 
apache first, and then myql, and then starting them again:

{{{
sudo /etc/init.d/httpd stop
sudo /etc/init.d/mysqld stop
sudo /etc/init.d/httpd start
sudo /etc/init.d/mysqld start
}}}
