!!!How to extract log information from Oahpa for research

As usual, commands on victorio.

!!For smeoahpa

Go to the oahpa catalogue.

{{{
mysql -u admin -p
salasana: 

mysql> use oahpa;
mysql> select * from drill_log order by game into outfile '/usr/tmp/oahpalog.txt' fields terminated by '|';
mysql> exit
}}}

The resulting file can then be gathered. Note that the command will overwrite earlier files in the tmp catalogue. As can be seen, more refined commands are possible (refining the log result).

Logs may also be extracted from the command line directly, and one program at a time. This command prints all the entries:

{{{
python manage.py [help] printlogs
}}}

Cf. an actual example:

{{{
$ python manage.py printlogs --game numra
numra|2011/12/27|9|9|True|ovcci|None|None
numra|2011/12/27|1|1|True|okta|None|None
numra|2011/12/27|3|3|True|golbma|None|None
}}}



!!For other oahpa versions

Go to the smaoahpa (etc.) catalogue. We use smaoahpa as example, replace with smnoahpa etc.

{{{
mysql -u admin -p
salasana: 

mysql> use smaoahpa;
mysql> select * from smadrill_log order by game into outfile '/usr/tmp/smaoahpalog.txt' fields terminated by '|';
mysql> exit
}}}

â€¦ and correspondingly for the command line option.
