!!!How to extract log information from Oahpa for research

As usual, commands on victorio.




!!Procedure

We have different language versions. The commands here use ''sma'', replace
with ''sjd'', etc. For univ_oahpa, replace with univ_. 
For the __old__ (sme) oahpa, remove the prefix, and write only 
''oahpa, drill_log'', etc.

On victorio, go to the production catalogue (not actually needed):

{{{
mysql -u admin -p
salasana: 

mysql> use smaoahpa;
mysql> select * from smadrill_log order by game into outfile '/usr/tmp/smaoahpalog.txt' fields terminated by '|';
mysql> exit
}}}

â€¦ and correspondingly for the command line option.

Note that the command on gtoahpa is

{{{
mysql -u root -p
}}}

The relevant variables are found in the file {{pro...}}.

Here is the command set for old oahpa:

{{{
mysql> use oahpa;
mysql> select * from drill_log order by game into outfile '/usr/tmp/oahpalog.txt' fields terminated by '|';
}}}

The resulting file can then be gathered. As can be seen, more refined commands 
are possible (refining the log result).

Logs may also be extracted from the command line directly, and one program 
at a time. This command prints all the entries:

{{{
python manage.py printlogs 
}}}

Note that this demands python 2.6 on some machines and 2.7 on others.

Cf. an actual example, with the option --game set (no option gives all programs):

{{{
$ python2.6 manage.py printlogs --game numra
numra|2011/12/27|9|9|True|ovcci|None|None
numra|2011/12/27|1|1|True|okta|None|None
numra|2011/12/27|3|3|True|golbma|None|None
}}}
