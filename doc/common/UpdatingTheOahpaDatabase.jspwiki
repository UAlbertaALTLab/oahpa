Updating the database

The script {{install.py}} is used for updating the database. First, cd to the ped/oahpa directory and then test the script.

{{{
cd ped/oahpa/
python install.py -h
}}}


Changes in the database are visible in the interface straight away. Running the same installation script several times is not harmful. The same command that is used for installing the information can be used for updating.
