!!!Vasta and Morfa-C

!! File dependencies

* Word lexicon file (n_smanob.xml)
* Paradigm file (paradigms.txt)
* tags file (tags.txt)

!!! paradigms.txt

Both the paradigms file and tags file are important for Morfa-S and Morfa-C to function. paradigms.txt is simply a list of all of the tags for the wordforms that will be generated. These are separated by newlines.

    V+Ind+Prs+Sg1
    V+Ind+Prs+Sg2
    V+Ind+Prs+Sg3
	etc...

It may be useful to split up the paradigm files by part of speech, in order to have more detailed control over the paradigms in the event that certain kinds of verbs need to be separated from eachother, and so on... 

NOTE: If you split up paradigm files, it is important to also have one file containing all of the possible tag strings, because tag and paradigm files are also installed separately for Morfa-C.

!!! tags.txt

This file defines tag classes and groups. It is required for both Morfa-C and Morfa-S. The file is a collection of lists of individual tags (Prop, Pers, Logo; PxSg1, PxSg2, etc.) split up by a name.

   #Subclass
   Prop
   Pers
   Logo
   #Possessive
   PxSg1
   PxSg2
   PxSg3

This file may also be used to generate custom tag sets for Morfa-C, so that when creating questions, one could refer to only 1st and 2nd persons:

   #1st2ndPerson
   Sg1
   Sg2
   Du1
   Du2
   Pl1
   Pl2

In Morfa-C these tags are used in both question files and grammar_defaults.xml any time a tag is specified:

	<grammar tag="Pron+Pers+1st2ndPerson+Nom" />


!!! grammar_defaults.xml

Grammar_defaults is a collection of shortcuts for oft repeated material, which may be used in Morfa-C questions. They may be overridden by specifying in more detail in the individual question files. Grammar default definitions and syntax follow those in question files, and they must be included in the install of every question file. They also rely on paradigms and tags files, because they may refer to tagsets.

{{{
	python install.py -g grammar_defaults.xml -q question_file.xml
}}}

!!Intro

Morfa-C and Vasta share the same mechanism for installing the
questions. Questions are defined, for example, in
sme/xml/questions_vasta.xml. In addition some defaults for certain
elements (such as subject/SUBJ) are defined in
sme/xml/grammar_defaults.xml. 

Morfa-C and Vasta also use tag, tag-set and paradigm information, which is
installed separately and maintained in tags.txt and paradigms.txt. In order
for Morfa-C and Vasta to function properly, these must be updated before installing.

Sometimes, additional words are required which are not in the other lexicon files.
These are stored in a fillings file, which is installed like any other word lexicon
file.

!! Adding question types

To add a new question type to Morfa-C I need to edit the following files, often doing things that are repeated across multiple places

 * smadrill/game.py 

 * smadrill/views.py 
 ** Add a key-value pair to self.gamenames

 * smadrill/forms.py
 ** ContextMorfaQuestion, CASE_CONTEXT_CHOICES, PRON_CONTEXT_CHOICES, etc.

 * smadrill/mgame.py 

!!Dependencies

* questions file
* grammar defaults file
* tags file
* paradigm file


!!Installation

1. Install grammar tags and paradigm information
{{{
	python install.py -r data_sma/meta/paradigms.txt -t data_sma/meta/tags.txt -b
}}}
2. Install fillings (optional)
{{{
	python install.py -f fillingsfile.xml --paradigmfile paradigms.txt --tagfile tags.txt
}}}
3. Install question file
{{{
python install.py -g ../sme/xml/grammar_defaults.xml -q ../sme/xml/questions_nouns.xml
}}}

Everything inside the question xml-file may be changed and the database
will be updated during the next. With one exception: if a question is
removed and there is no new question with the same id, it has to be
specifically deleted using command:
 
{{{
python install.py --qid <question_id>
.. or by using the question text
python install.py --qid "Maid SUBJ MAINV"
}}}

Of course the latter command will delete all the questions with that
string. However, the deletion with the string may be useful if the qid
was forgotten. Rerun of the installation script for the question file
will restore the accidentally deleted questions.
