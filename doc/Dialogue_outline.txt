Outline for writing dialogues
=============================

These are important documents:  

ped/sme/xml/dialogue_visit.xml -   
ped/sme/xml/dialoguepart_calendar.xml - with questions/anwers/feedback - now with translations to English
ped/sme/xml/dialogue_firstmeeting.xml - with open questions
ped/doc/dialogueparts.txt - ideas for topics

The dialogues are made of elements, and we can write the dialogues if we can agree on the possible type of elements even if not all the programming is ready. 


Elements
========

Setting
-------
Every dialogue has a setting, e.g. cafe. The dialogue contains several topics, e.g. drinking, eating, paying. 
The setting is given to U by M as an utterance or as a set of utterances in the beginning of the dialogue.

Topic
-------
Every topic contains several questions and utterances. e.g. Do you drink coffee?

Every topic starts with s "opening"-utt and in the end is a "closing"-utt. This make it easy to put many topics together.


Utterances
----------
M gives utterances to make the conversation more natural and give the impression of a two-way communication. It is also good teaching because U will get a model for her own answer.

The utterances may be encoded in the dialogue source code as the following type of elements (note the underscore):
<question name="utterance_string">
<utt>utterance string</utt>
<opening>utterance string</opening>
<closing>utterance string</closing>


4 types of questions
---------------------
- Open Wh-question - the answer should be in right case, but it has no consequenses for the next question. First speller and then to default.
	Eks.	What is your name?
		 	What kind of work do you have?
	
- Closed Wh-question - answer alternatives are in a list or a picture, or is implisit in the question. The answer determines the next question. If U answers something outside the alternatives, then M comments like "I have not got that. Here you see what I have got." M does not have to "understand" the answer.
	Eks. 	What do you want to eat? (pick from a meny)
			Do you want coffee or tea?
	
- Correct/not-correct Wh-question - there is only one correct answer, in a picture or something else. Feedback to U about the correct formulation.
	Eks. 	When is Lemet´s birhtday?  
			Which car is the most expensive one?
			In which month is Easter?
			When does the school start up after the summervacation?


- go-question (yes-no-questions) - answer determines the next question.
	Eks.	Do you want coffee?

	
Tutorial comments - this is not ready.... - some examples in ped/sme/xml/dialoguepart_calendar.xml
---------------------------	
1. speller - if the words are not correctly spelled, M will not know them. 
2. clarifying question, eks. In which month does school start? It can not be the correct month!
3. Lexical help: You perhaps do not know the name of the months? + a list of the months names.
4. Grammatical help, like: "liikot-verb demands illative - e.g. Mun liikon guollái." "Do you want to learn more about illative?"
or "In sami we write date like this - borgemánu 20.b."
