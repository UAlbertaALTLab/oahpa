!!!Kildin SÃ¡mi oahpa crash course first aid kit


!!!Intro and stuff


!!!Howto

!! The commands

# ==> assumption that mysql is installed and can communicate with django via python
# ==> assumption that you have already create the project and the applications
      via django-admin

Caveat: This should be a new project, the settings in, for instance, sjdoahpa/settings.py
are for the victorio server!

mysql must be running. To make it run:

{{start mysql server via system_preferences/control_panel/mysql}}

!! Installing the database

log in to the mysql application via terminal

{{$ mysql -u root -p}}

Then in the mysql-shell,  see what dbs you have.

{{mysql> show databases; }}

suppose that you don't have sjdoahpa,
but suppose that you HAVE installed mysql (I installed it for Trond)
however, one has to make mysql talk to django via python
(see above)

Create sjdoahpa (this is only the db, no other tables in it), and then
log out from mysql.

{{{
mysql> create database sjdoahpa character set utf8 collate utf8_bin; 
mysql> exit; 
}}}

go into the oapha dir (ks salasana)

{{{
$ cd sjdoahpa/sjd_oahpa/
$ less settings.py
}}}

Install the tables in the newly created (or just empty) db called sjdoahpa.
Watch out: you have to answer yes/no to a question in the terminal during 
the installation of the db


{{$ python manage.py syncdb}}

Now install dictionaries

{{{
$ python install.py -f ../sjd/dict_sjd-rus.xml \# one dic
$ python install.py -f ../sjd/dict_rus-sjd.xml \# and the other
}}}

Now, all should be installed properly.

!! Start app

Start application from sjdoahpa/sjd_oahpa/ dir

{{$ python manage.py runserver}}

The url where sjd_oahpa is found on the local machine is: 

* [http://127.0.0.1:8000/sjd_oahpa/|http://127.0.0.1:8000/sjd_oahpa/]

!!Adding words

# add words in the xml file
# install dictionaries as described above


!!Localisation

This is as usual:
{{{
$ django-admin.py makemessages -a
$ django-admin.py compilemessages
}}}

The keyboard issue:

Report from Audun:

Esa Anttikoski's README file: (ReadMeEng.rtf)

KEYBOARD LAYOUT FOR WINDOWS NT/2000/XP

[http://www.peoples.org.ru/eng_key32U.html|http://www.peoples.org.ru/eng_key32U.html]

This keyboard layout replaces the standard Russian keyboard for
Windows NT/2000/XP. Before installing a new layout, you must
have the standard Russian keyboard installed. You must also have 
administrative rights on your computer.

HOW TO INSTALL THE KEYBOARD LAYOUT

1) Download the zip-file, open it in a temporary folder, for example,
c:\keyboard

2) Copy the file kbdnewcy.dll in c:\keyboard to the system folder 
c:\windows\system32 (for Windows 2000/XP) or c:\winnt\system32 (for
Windows NT4). In case you cannot see the file kbdnewcy.dll, choose
"Show all files" in "View" > "Options" > "View".

3) Run the file regnewcy in the folder c:\keyboard. Answer "yes" to 
the question about registering the information it contains.

4) Restart Windows

In order to return to the standard Russian keyboard, run unregnew in 
the folder c:\keyboard and restart Windows.

ADDITIONAL LETTERS are typed with thw help of AltGr (= right Alt) and
Shift:

- AltGr + letter = corresponding additional small letter (for example, 
AltGr + Cyrillic "en" = Cyrillic "en" with hook)

- AltGr + Shift + letter = corresponding additional capital letter (for 
example, AltGr + Shift + Cyrillic "en" = Cyrillic "EN" with hook) 

The author takes no responsability for any possible damage that might 
occure while installing and using the keyboard layout. Send your 
comments and suggestions to: Esa.Anttikoski@joensuu.fi

Hei

Jeg ser at disse filene er laget i 2003. Derfor er de nok ikke kompatible med dagens versjoner av Windows, men det er jo ikke sikkert de fleste der borte bruker Vista og Win7. 

Jeg la driveren inn der den skulle, men jeg fikk den ikke opp som valg.
