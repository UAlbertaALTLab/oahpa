!!!VERY OLD Status

# Infrastructure
# Localisation
# Linguistic analysers
# Lexicon

!!! Infrastructure

The catalogues ped/rus_oahpa and ped/rus have been set up, and
references are changed from sjd to rus (but not tested).

Many linguistic settings are still made for Sami, and not changed.
There is reference to stem type and not to gender, etc.

__TODO__
* Read documentation
* Go through ped/rus_oahpa and ped/rus, correct and add files

!!! Localisation

__TODO__
* Generate the django.po files, and translate.


!!! Linguistic analysers

What is needed is to get Russian lexemes from the textbook and from 
Wiktionary, and include them in a Finite State Transducer. This
process is discussed on the [Russian Morphological Transducer page|RussianMorphologicalTransducer.html].

__TODO__
* Get fsts from [Apertium|http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Russian], either sh-ru or udm-rus.
* Get more lexemes from [Wiktionary|http://dumps.wikimedia.org/ruwiktionary/]. There are many download options, the one we want is probably called ''pages-articles.xml.bz2''.
* make an analyser and put it in main/gt/rus/src
* Goal: Paradigm generation, later also text analysis


!!! Lexicon

__TODO__

* Write the words of the UiT textbook (appr 1000) on the form
  ''lemma_POS_SEMCLASS_nobtrans_engtrans''
* Store them in {{main/st/rus/oahpa/leksa.csv}}
* Translate the result to xml files and store them in {{main/ped/rus/src}}, 
  the structure should be the same as for the other languages.


!!! Django setup on the server

North and South Sami run on gtoahpa.uit.no, and Kildin and Inari Sami
run on victorio.uit.no. The goal is to have all oahpa versions running on
gtoahpa.uit.no. We need a catalogue for rusoahpa next to smaoahpa on
the gtoapha.uit.no server.
