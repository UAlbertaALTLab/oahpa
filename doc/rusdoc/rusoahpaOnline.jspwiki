At present, rusoahpa is on gtlab, in {{/home/rusoahpa}}

__Hmm, no it is not. Has it been accidently deleted?__

The url is: [testing.oahpa.no/rusoahpa/|http://testing.oahpa.no/rusoahpa/]

Setup is done with the script {{/home/rusoahpa/rusoahpa/rusoahpa.sh}}.

Goal: make a script in {{/etc/init.d}}.
