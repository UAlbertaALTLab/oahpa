The Russian Wiktionary gives two types of information about its words:

# The Zaliznjak number
# An inflectional template number.

According to Apertium experience, the Zaliznjak number in itself is not
sufficient to generate all the paradigm forms. Instead, they use a script, 
[ruwiktionaryextract.pl], which gives the output depicted in 
[ruwiktionaryextractoutput.txt].

From the full paradigm given in the output, they find the maximal common 
suffix string, and make the paradigm patterns, here for nominals and verbs:

* [The Apertium system for Russian Conjugation|ApertiumRussianConjugation.html]
* [The Apertium system for Russian Declension|ApertiumRussianDeclension.html]

Note that the html files from which the paradigms are made contain the stress information.


Important for rusoahpa is to get an fst which is easy to maintain.
