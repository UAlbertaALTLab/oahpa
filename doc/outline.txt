Outline of learning sami through dialogs
========================================


Page: Welcome - choose conversation mate 
-----------------------------------------
The student can choose an identity for computer for the conversation (s/he chooses a picture), eg.:
- Ánne from Karasjok - (adult)
- Isak from Karasjok - (child)
- Biera from Kautokeino - (adult)
- Biret from Kautokeino - (child)
- Oliva from Kåfjord - (adult)
- Hánsa from Kåfjord - (child)

These identities will act as parameters for choice of comments from the computer, and for dialogue topics and dialect forms:

dialect
 eastern - Karasjok
 western - Kautokeino, Kåfjord
topic
 adult
 child
comments
 different kind of "lifestories", like "I am 40 years old." "I have a red Ford."

 
The student can choose tutorial language:
- Norwegian
- English
- Sami (for sami-speaking students who want to train writing and grammar)

Page: Choose conversation topic
----------------------------------

The purpose of the conversations are:
- training useful words and expressions
- training grammar (to every topic belong naturally grammatical functions.)

To every topic there will be drawings.

Topics - e.g:
- Get to know each other (Oahpásmuvvan)
	Verbs: 1sg, 2sg?
	Phrases
- Family and house (Bearaš ja orrunsadji)
	Verbs: 1sg, 1du, 1pl, 2sg, 3sg, 3du, 3pl
	Nouns: locative	
- Clothes shop (Bivttasgávpi) - pictures are essential
	Verbs: 3sg, 3du, 3pl
	Nouns: accusative, locative (many trisyllabic nouns)
	Adjectives: attribute and predicative forms, comparision
	Prices
- Travelling (Mátkái)
	Verbs:
	Nouns: locative, illative, comitative 	
	Timeexpressions
- Dining (Boradeapmi) - pictures are essential
	Verbs: also imperative (?)		
	Personal pronouns: lokative, illative
	Nouns: accusative, illative
- Plan of the day/week (Vahkku)	
	Verbs: auxiliaries + infititive
	Time
	Phrases
- In the city (Gávpogis) - conversation about pictures
	Pre/postpositions	
	Adverbs
	
The student can do some choices according to some of the topics, e.g:
- Verbs are only in present tense
- Adjectives without comparision

Page: Dialogue
------------------
The computer asks, the students answers. The computer identities have their own lifestories, and the computer will make comments like: "I live in Tromsø. Where do you live?" "I am 30 years old. How old are you?" It will make the conversation more natural and give the impression of a two-way communication. It is also good teaching because the student will get a model for her own answer. 

The dialog is divided into sections, and a positive answer will sometimes lead to a new section.

The questions are made so the student usually gets a couple of the same kind, so s/he has the chance to do better. E.g. 2-3 illative-questions following.

The student gets feedback about a grammatical error.
In the tutorial section s/he can get a proposal like:
"Do you want to take a training session of illative?" 

Page: Grammar training session (parallell page)
-----------------------------------------------
A short explanation of how to form the word, and then 15 words s/he has to inflect. The student gets statistics and comments about her/his achievement, and a proposal of doing a new training session. If not, s/he goes back to the conversation (and continues where s/he was).

----- How it works:
Bisyllabic, trisyllabic and contracted verbs/nouns/adjectives, but random in every group (from pedagogical lexicons so the students trains useful words).

The training will then be a predefined set of morphosyntactic features, paired with a set of words, combined with a random function. The student shall provide correct wordforms.


An outline of how it can work:
a lexicon of nouns, verbs, adjectives - numbered
every lexicon is devided into three parts, one for bisyllabic (e.g 1-100), one for trisyllabic (e.g 101-200) and one for contracted stems (e.g 200-250).
 
There will be three random functions (or you can put in a fixed choice) so it is possible to run different kinds, e.g:

N (random 1-100)(Sg)(Ill)			<this will use only bisyllabic nouns, only Sg Ill>
N (random 1-250)(Pl)(random case)	<this will pick from the whole noun lexicon, all cases in Pl>
N (random 1-250)(random Sg/Pl)(random case)	<this will pick from the whole nounlexicon, all cases in both Pl and Sg>

verbs:
V (random 1-100)(Ind/Cond/Pot/Imp)(random Pr/Prt)(random Sg/Pl)(random 1/2/3) if possible, if not: (random Sg1, Sg2...)

adjectives:
A (random 1-100)(Ø/Comp/Sup)(random Sg/Pl)(random case)

----
This grammar training session will also be offered to the students as it is, outside the dialogue.

Go to "Page: Farewell" or to "Page: Choose conversation topic"


Page: Farewell
--------------
Some comments about her/his achievement? Links to useful sites? Links to VISL
Close down or go to "Page: Welcome - choose conversation mate" to do it once more or to choose another conversation mate.
