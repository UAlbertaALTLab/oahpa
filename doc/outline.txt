Outline of learning sami through dialogs
========================================


Page: Welcome - choose conversation mate 
-----------------------------------------
The student can choose an identity for the conversation (drawings), eg.:
- Ánne from Karasjok - (35 years old)
- Isak from Karasjok - (12 years old)
- Biera from Kautokeino - (40 years old)
- Biret from Kautokeino - (13 years old)
- Oliva from Kåfjord - (40 years old)
- Hánsa from Kåfjord - (15 years old)

The student can choose tutorial language:
- norwegian
- english
- sami (for sami-speaking students who want to train writing and grammar)

Page: Choose conversation subject
----------------------------------

The purpose of the conversations are:
- training useful words and expressions
- training grammar (to every subject belong naturally grammatical functions.)

To every subject there will be drawings.

Subjects - e.g:
- Get to know each other (Oahpásmuvvan)
	Verbs: 1sg
	Phrases
- Family and house (Bearaš ja orrunsadji)
	Verbs: 1sg, 1du, 1pl, 2sg, 3sg, 3du, 3 pl
	Nouns: locative	
- Clothes shop (Bivttasgávpi) - pictures are essential
	Verbs: 3sg, 3du, 3pl
	Nouns: accusative, locative (many trisyllabic nouns)
	Adjectives: attribute and predicative forms, comparision
	Prices
- Travelling (Mátkái)
	Verbs:
	Nouns: locative, illative, comitative 	
	Timeexpressions
- Dining (Boradeapmi) - pictures are essential
	Verbs: also imperative (?)		
	Personal pronouns: lokative, illative
	Nouns: accusative, illative
- Plan of the day/week (Vahkku)	
	Verbs: auxiliaries + infititive
	Time
	Phrases
- In the city (Gávpogis) - conversation about pictures
	Pre/postpositions	
	Adverbs
	
The student can do some choices according to some of the subjects, e.g:
- Verbs are only in presence
- Adjectives without comparision

Page: Dialog
------------------
The computer asks, the students answers. The computer identities have their own lifestories, and the computer will make comments like: "I live in Tromsø. Where do you live?" "I am 30 years old. How old are you?" It will make the conversation more natural and give the impression of a two-way communication. It is also good teaching because the student will get a model for her own answer. 

The dialog is devided into sections, and a positive answer will sometimes lead to a new section.

The questions are made so the student usually gets a couple of the same kind, so s/he has the chance to do better. E.g. 2-3 illative-questions following.

The student gets feedback about a grammatical error.
In the tutorial section s/he can get a proposal like:
"Do you want to take a training session of illative?" 

Page: Grammar training session (parallell page)
-----------------------------------------------
A short explanation of how to form the word, and then 15 words s/he has to inflect. The student gets statistics and comments about her/his achievement, and a proposal of doing a new training session. Bisyllabic, trisyllabic and contractions, but random in every group (from pedagogical lexicons so the students trains useful words).

If not, s/he goes back to the conversation (and continue where s/he was).
