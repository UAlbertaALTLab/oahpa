Vasta - Some issues


Location adverbs are not accepted as locative or illative:
Ruoktot, vulos not accepted as illative
Olgun, maddin, lulde, guhkkin not accepted as locative: 
ex. sii leat olgun: - svaret burde inneholde en lokativ

"Geaid X dát leat?" questions receive the feedback "Svaret burde inneholde en akkusativ". These are genitive questions. Although the accusative and genitive forms are similar, should we not make a distinction here? Also, it seems that there is a requirement to leave out the possession NP.
Ex.
Geaid niibi dát lea?
Dat lea etniid/mánáid niibii
- Svaret burde inneholde en akkusativ
Dat lea mánáid. - Accepted

Numerals
==========
Numeral rules requiring the gen form in nouns following a numeral bigger than 1, should not apply to plural forms.
ex:
Gallit gaskabeaivvit leat dáid beassážiid?
Dáid beassážiid leat golmmat gaskabeaivvit (Not accepted, although it is correct)
- Sjekk bøyninga av substantivet etter numeral
Dáid beassážiid leat golmmat gaskabeivviid = (accepted as answer, although it is wrong)

Gradation errors
===================

Geaidda don attát gásaid.
"Gássa" in the meaning of cardboard box has invisible gradation, also according to the ped lexicon.  "Gássa" in the meaning "gas" is not natural in this context.

Maid lávllu-guovttos bargaba?
Lávlu belongs to ACTOR, and should not have gradation. This is also according to our ped-lexicon, but still the gradated form occurs in the games.


Rections
==========

Rection verbs are only required to have objects of a certain case, when the verbs occur in the questions. However, these verbs can also be used as answers to the Maid X barget odne/ikte? questions, and the case of the following noun is not checked. All these answers were accepted:
Sii njuvvet bohccuiguin. Sii balle gussii. Son humai áhči mielde.
Nouns in the nominative case after transitive verbs are commented on:
 Sii lohket girji
-Det passer ikke med nom. etter et transitivt verb.
Sii lohket girjin =Accepted as answer.

Should the obvious rection verbs also have a "det passer ikke..." feedback, for example ballat/luohttit/jáhkkit.

Word order
=============

Answers beginning with the negation are not accepted:
Stunže go bagadeaddji odne?
Ii son stunže
- er du sikker på at du svarer i riktig person
Son ii stunže odne: accepted

In yes-no questions it is quite natural to begin with the negation. The feedback is also not informative for the user.



Strange feedback
=================

Sometimes the computer does not recognize a space between words:
Maid don barggat odne?
Odne mun oađašan
- "Odnemun" finnes ikke i vårt leksikon. Kan det være en skrivefeil
Correction: Mun oađašan odne: - "Munoađašan" finnes ikke i vårt leksikon osv.


Other
====

Comitative questions which are only supposed to use  COMV verbs, use all verbs, and we get strange questions like: geaiguiin dii lágidehpet?

"Man duohkái SUBJ MAINV" questions have defined  MAINV to "čiehkádit", but the questions use all verbs, giving things like: Man duohkái gávpebargit málestedje
