Sahka - Some issues

Visit

Overall:
========
We should probably vary the verbs a little. There are 8 questions with the verb "bidjat", and since the computer does not accept answers with a different verb, the user is stuck with this verb. Other verbs such as "heivet", "guoddit", "doalvut" also need to be answered with the illative when combined with "gosa" or "guđe latnjii". In the dialogue "Grocery", several different verbs yielding the same types of answers have been used.

Strange feedback:
=================
Gievkkanis lea vuogas čohkkát. Lássaráiggis oaidná meara. Manne go gievkkanii?
Mannu fal.
- Lássaráiggisoaidná" finnes ikke i vårt leksikon. Kan det være en skrivefeil?
Correcting the answer to Moai manne gievkkanii did not help, and the same feedback was given. The dialogue stops there.

An answer like : Dan bidje stohpui gives the feedback:
-Husk kongruens mellom subjekt og verbal
The answer was corrected to: Dan bidjá stohpui.
This was accepted, although the question was Guđe latnjii moai bidje láhttelámppá?

Grocery

Overall:
========
We should have more grocery options. I will come up with more words with imparisyllabic stems (preferably with gradation) and contracted stems (if there are any). I also think we need more consonant centre types among the options, if the idea is to practise the accusative.
4 different verbs have been used, "áigut", "háliidit", "oastit" and "váldit". The latter two are used once each over the 9 questions. I think there is too much "áigut" and "háliidit" still.

Strange feedback:
=================
Makkár njálgáid don háliidat?
Mun háliidan keavssaid.
- Verbet skal ikke være finitt - kanskje infinitiv passer?
Answer corrected to: Háliidan keavssaid. This is accepted. 

Makkár njálgáid don háliidat?
In hálit njálgáid.
- Svaret burde inneholde en akkusativ.
