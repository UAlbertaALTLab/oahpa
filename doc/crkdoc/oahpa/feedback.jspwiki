!!!Feedback/hints to the student about the morphology

The feedback consists of three parts:
# the combination of properties of the stem and the task itself gives triggers like "k-gives-w" (look at. ped/meta/feedback_nouns.xml)
# the trigger gives a sentence or part of a sentence in the chosen language (look at. messages.eng.xml, k-gives-w gives "Add -w- because the stem is ending with -k.")
# the properties of the stem is given in the <l>-element in e.g. ped/src/N_crk.xml (but not to the ones marked with genonly="none")

You are free to give names to the triggers, and the properties as you want.

Have a look at the files in ped/crk/meta:

There is an attribute rime in the <l>-element in the N-file (you are free to rename it) and it is used like this:
{{{
    <l animacy="AN">    
      <msg number="Pl">plural-ak</msg> 
      <note> </note>
    </l>
This message is given to all AN-nouns for Pl tasks (one could limit it with adding rime="0")

    <l animacy="AN" rime="k">
      <msg number="Pl">k-gives-w</msg>  
      <note> </note>
    </l>
Stems with rime="k" get also this message. One could consider to give only one message: the plural is -wak.

}}}

Locative - here we need more information about properties
{{{
     <l>
      <msg case="Loc">locative-ihk</msg>  
      <note>kohk√¥sihk</note>
    </l>
This is given both to AN and IN.

    <l animacy="IN">
      <msg case="Loc">locative-ahk</msg>  
      <note> </note>
    </l>
This is given only to IN, but needs properties.
    
    <l animacy="AN">
      <msg case="Loc">locative-inaahk</msg> 
      <note> </note>
    </l>
This is given only to AN, but needs properties.
}}}

One can choose to give a hint about -hk to all, and then give more information, as is done for plural. Or one can give the whole Locative information of each type, as one message.


Possessive hints are made of two parts for circumfixes:
{{{
    <l>
      <msg possessive="1Sg">prefix-n</msg>
      <msg possessive="2Sg">prefix-k</msg>
      <msg possessive="3Sg">prefix-o</msg>
      <msg possessive="4Sg">prefix-o</msg>
      <msg possessive="1Pl">prefix-n</msg>
      <msg possessive="12Pl">prefix-k</msg>
      <msg possessive="2Pl">prefix-k</msg>
      <msg possessive="3Pl">prefix-o</msg>
      <msg possessive="4Pl">prefix-o</msg>
      <note> </note>
    </l>

    <l>
      <msg possessive="3Sg">obviative</msg>
      <msg possessive="4Sg">iyiw-Obv</msg>
      <msg possessive="1Pl">inaan</msg>
      <msg possessive="12Pl">inaw</msg>
      <msg possessive="2Pl">iwaaw</msg>
      <msg possessive="3Pl">iwaaw</msg>
      <msg possessive="4Pl">iyiw-Obv</msg>
      <note> </note>
    </l>
}}}

The message for Plural can be:

# WORDFORM is an animate noun 
# and the plural suffix is -ak. 
# Add -w- because the stem is ending with -k.

The message for possessive can be:

# WORDFORM is an animate noun for possessive 4Sg:
# The possessive prefix is o- or w-. 
# The possessive suffix -iyiw- and remember obviative -a.
