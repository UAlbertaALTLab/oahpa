    <p><a href="http://testing.oahpa.no/crk_oahpa/">Oahpa</a> is a learner's aid for acquisition of languages with complex grammar, like Plains Cree. The programs make tasks for the students, and they can be integrated in course materiales, like we have done for North and South Saami, e.g. <a href="http://kursa.oahpa.no">North Saami Language courses for students</a>. The programs have many choices and therefore can be adapted to the students' level and needs. The teacher can give links to the students which include the relevant settings. Here is a brief introduction to each of the programs which are included in the Plains Cree demo: </p>
<p><strong>Numra</strong> - practice with numbers, dates, clock and money</p>
<p><strong>Leksa</strong> - practice with words</p>
<p><strong>Morfa S</strong> - inflection of nouns and verbs, individual words</p>
<p><strong>Morfa C</strong> - inflection of nouns and verbs in context (question + answer)</p>

<p>Be aware of that in the demo is only a start, a fully developed program will include much more tasks.</p> 
<p>The student can limit the vocabulary to what is given in the textbooks, or which are a part of the curriculum. In Leksa-program s/he can choose semantic field instead of book.</p>
<p>The name Oahpa is a North Saami word for: learn! This name and the names of each program can be changed to names, which sound better for the Cree students.</p>
