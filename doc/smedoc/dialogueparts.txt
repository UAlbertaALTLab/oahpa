Ideas to be included in the dialogues - just to see what kind of implements we need. I think most of it will be variants of the dialoguepart_calendar.xml
======================================



Calendar (Mu jahki):
=======================
Presented for the user as an image: A calender with notes.
 
The point is that in the calender the dates are only written with arabics. The user has to answer with the names of the months, and use the right case. Som eof the questions require boht month and day in the answer, some other questions require only the month. Below is an example with both month and day.

Examples of questions to the calendar: 
- Goas lea Lemeha riegádanbeaivvi?   (When is Lemet´s birthday?)
- Guđe mánus leat beassážat?	(In which month is Eastern?)
- Goas skuvla álgá dán čavčča? (When does the school start up after the summervacation?)
 
Another kind of this kind dialogue will be a plan for a week and then the student have to know weekdays and timeexpressions, and s/he will also have to use fin.verb + infinitive (e.g. I use to ...., I can ........)


In a room (Latnja):
=======================
Presented for the user: A picture of a room with furniture.

The point is that the student has to know adverbs and postpositions:

M: Mii lea beavddi vuolde?   (What is under the table?)
U: …………..  <- I have to define possible answers/synonyms, and how the pogression will be.
M: Mii heaŋgá seaŋgga bajábealde? (What is hanging above the bed?)
U: ………….. <-  

The other way round:
M: Gos spábba lea?  (Where is the ball?)
U: …………..  <-  
M: Gos lámpá lea?  (Where is the lamp?)
U: ………….. <-  



Map 1:
=======================
Presented for the user: A map of a town.

The point is that the student has to know adverbs and postpositions. The machine will give an instruction of where Lemet is living (vegforklaring), and the student is to find the right house.

M: Makkár ivdni lea Lemeha viesus?  
U: …………..  <- I have to define possible answers, and progression.

And then the student can try to find Kare´s house, and so on.


Map 2:
=======================
Presented for the user: A map of Tromsø.

The dialogue is about what to do in the town.

Album:
=======================
Presented for the user: Pictures from an album.

The point is to govern the dialogue into certain directions - e.g. training verbs.

1) Picture of an old man fishing.
M: Dovddat go mu áddjá gii lea dán govas?  (Do you know my grandfather who is at this photo?)
U: .................  <- I have to define possible answers, and progression.
M: Maid son bargá govas? (What does he do at the photo?)
U: .........................
M: Lávet go don oaggut?  (Do you fish?)
U: .........................
M: Gos don lávet oaggut?  (Where do you fish?)
U: .........................
M: Lávet go goddit ollu guoli?  (Do you usually catch much fish?)
U: .........................


2) Picture of a schoolclass, with names.

The point is training understanding, and to answer with propernoun in right case. 

M: Geas lea vilges báidi ja rukses buvssat?  (Who has white sweather and red trousers?)
U: ................. <== Right name and in Loc.





Travelling:
=======================
Presented for the user: A map with some placenames and information and small timetables for plane, train, bus, and so on. Symbols and arabics.

The point is that the student has to know timeexpressions, understand illative and locative and use comitative. The possible answers has to be defined, and then the follow-up-question/utterance.

M: Leat go don goassege leamaš Mázes?  (Have you ever been to Maze?)
U: .................
M: Guđe suohkanii Máze gullá?  (To which municipality does maze belong?)
U: ...........................
M: Mo son sáhtát Álttás vuolgit  Mázii?  (How can you go from Alta to Maze?)

U: .....................
M: Man guhká ádjána girdit Álttás Romsii? (How long does it take with plane from Alta to Tromsø?)
U: .....................


Shopping:
=======================
Presented for the user: A picture of things in a shop - with prices.
The student has to train to compare.





Visit: 
=======================
The user can choose if (s)he is one person, or she has company of one or two persons. This will make the dialogue to dual or plural.
