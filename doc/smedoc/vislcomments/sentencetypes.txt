The types of sentences
======================

From VISL-cafeteria:
The syntactic top-node receives the default function of UTT (utterance), but may be subdivided into STA statement, QUE question, COM command, EXC exclamation, PER performative.

COM: First word is "Imprt" (or second/third after a CS or Adv)

Dus ii leat lohpi dan dahkat! is STA, not COM.
-------

QUE: 
- First word is an Interr or goas, makkár, mo, govt, galle, gallát, gallis, manin, manne, gos,
- First or second word is Qst
- First word is "amma", "ammal" 

---------

EXC:
- One/two words, no verbal, "excl" in the end
"Vuoi, gáfat!"

-------
PER:
"Giitu!" should be one??
Hard to from distinguish from EXC.
