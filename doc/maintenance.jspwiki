Much to say here, but for now only notes on first-aid.

!!mysqld down?

The reason might be a memory leak. Check that on victorio by writing:

__ps aux | grep http__

If the result indicates memory use too close to 100, this is a clear problem indication. The answer is to restart the apache web server, and thereafter, if need, to restart mysql. 


The magic commands are (you must have root rights):

* __sudo /etc/init.d/httpd restart__
* __sudo /etc/init.d/mysqld start__
