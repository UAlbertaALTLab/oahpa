        <title>Dialogue 1. Oahpásmuvvan.</title>

        <ul>
          <li>M: Buorre beaivi!</li>

          <li>S: Ipmel atti! / Buorre beaivi! / Buorre beaivi fal! </li>

          <li>M: Gii don leat?</li>
          
          <li>S: Mun lean Anne. / Anne. (The question allows also this kind of answer: Mun lean studeanta. The machine could compare to the Prop-lex? If it can´t handle it, we could use "Mii du namma lea?") </li>
          	
          <li>M: Mun lean Risten. Suohtas deaivat du, Anne. Gos don orut? (demands Loc)</li>
          
          <li>S: Mun orun Romssas.</li>
          
          <li>M: Gos don leat eret? (demands Loc)</li>
          
          <li>S: Mun lean Omasvuonas eret./ Omasvuonas.</li>
          
          <li>M: Leat go barggus?</li>
          
          <li>S: De lean. (pos > quostion(s) about work)</li>
          <li>S: In leat. / (In.) (mainverb should be compulsory)</li>
          
          <li>M: Gos don barggat? (demands Loc)</li>
          
          <li>S: Mun barggan skuvllas. / Skuvllas.</li>
          
          <li>M: Leago dus biila?</li>
          
          <li>S: De lea. / Mus lea (biila/Ford). / Lea. / Ii leat. / Mus ii leat biila.</li>	
          <li> More tricky answers: Mus leamaš biila. Mus lei biila ovdal. </li>

      <title>Question types</title>

      <p>What kind of questions the computer asks together with different
      types of answers.  
      Two kinds of questions, Wh- and go-questions. 
      Wh-questions: Case of wh-word tells which case the noun should have in the answer. 
      If the student uses wrong case, then she gets response, and she gets the same question again. And then she gets a new question with the same kind of wh-word so she learns it better.
      
      Go-questions: In some dialogs a positive answer will lead to a new section of questions, f.i. if the student answer that she has got a car, then the machine asks 3-4 questions about the car, before the machine continue. The questions about the car, can be single questions (like how old the car is, what kind of, what colour, is it a good car), so it is not important for the machine to "understand" the answer.
      Go-questions are especially for training verb-inflection, so verb can be compulsory, so the student has to train.       
      
      </p>

      <section>
        <title>go-questions</title>

        <p>Jugatgo gáfe? (demands presence and Acc)</p>

        <p>Different possible answers together with comments:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Jugan / Mun jugan / De jugan / Juo, mun jugan. (verbinflection is the same)</li>

          <li>In. (mainverb should be compulsory for ped. reasons)</li>

          <li>In juga. / In juga gáfe / In juga maidege. (verbinflection is the same, "maidege" is Acc)</li>
          
          <li> In juga gáfe, mun jugan deaja. (neg pres. verb + Acc, pos pres. verb + Acc)<li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Wh-questions</title>

        <p>Maid don jugat? (demands presence and Acc)</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Bruvssa. (Acc - mainverb should be compulsory for ped. reasons)</li>

          <li>Mun jugan bruvssa. (presence and Acc)</li>
          
          <li>In juga maidege (neg pres + Acc).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Settings</title>

        <p>The questions are grouped in settings, we could also have settings with pictures, and ask about things the student will see in the picture, f.i. articles in a shop with prices, and ask the students what she will buy, what it will cost and so on.. or a map and ask the student about travelling, training place-cases.</p>

        <ul>
          <li></li>

          <li></li>
        </ul>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Other responses to the user.</title>

      <p>The other things that the computer says, like "I like coffee too",
      followed by the next question. These are described in more detail in
      each dialogue, but something general guidlines, ideas, situations where
      the computer can comment the user could be listed here.</p>

      <section>
        <title>Comment type 1.</title>

        <p>The computer cuold have a personality and it´s own "lifestory", like name, age, where she/he lives, kind of work and so on, and could make comments like: "I live in Tromsø. Where do you live?" "I am 30 years old. How old are you?" It will make the conversation more natural, and also be good teaching because the student will get a model for her own answer, especially when the computer is introducing a new kind of question. We could use this way of conversation also in the settings, like in the store: "I want to buy a book. What do you want to buy?" "My book costs 50 kr. How much does your pencil cost?" With a map: "I will go to Rovaniemi. Where will you go?"  </p>
        <p>Humor: A "personality" will make it possible for the computer to give some funny comments about herself.  </p>

    <section>
      <title>Tutorial dialogue</title>

      <p>(I just write here some of my considerations, please rewrite where
      needed) The system gives feedback and makes suggestions on the basis of
      errors produced by the user. The language of the feedback? If we have
      feedback only in Sámi, then it must be really simple (avoid grammatical
      terms). (Should it avoid grammtical terms? Lene). It is not difficult to do different versions of feedback for
      different languages, since the sentences that are used in feedback are
      static.</p>

      <p>The tutorial dialogue can be implemented as part of the general
      dialogue as: -What did you buy? - I buy bread. - Did you mean: You
      bought bread? (perhaps alternatives) - Yes ... Or the tutorial dialogue
      can be separate from the actual dialogue, it can be a pop-up window or
      something more pleasant: a side bar that contains the feedback, or.. (shuold be separated from the actual dialogue. Lene)</p>

      <p>Are there different levels in the feedback? (Yes, it should be. Lene) First, "There is a wrong
      form in the sentence the word "___" , Let's try again" If the form is
      wrong again, then provide the grammatical form where the word should be
      in "The correct form is nominative", if the user fails then give the
      correct alternatives "Perhaps you meant __ or __?". It would be an idea to use sets, f.i. LIQUIDS. So if the student spell "brufssa" instead of "bruvssa", then she first get as responce that there is a wrong spelling, second would be correct alternatives, but only from the LIQUID set. The speller of today, gives also alternative like "Bruåsa"..... We have already some sets in the sme-dis.rle, and I could improve them (also good for the sme-dis.) </p>

      <p>How the user responds to the feedback? Does she merely choose from
      the list or is she required to write the sentence again? (Lene: The student should write again, and then afterwards get 1-2 questions of the same grammtical kind so she get training.)</p>

      <p>The form of the feedback is created beforehand. The feedback is
      different in different situations. We probably want to "teach" the user,
      give grammatical information, reasons why the form she used is wrong,
      etc. The types of feedback have to be thought carefully. (I just add
      couple of examples, please fill in the list of feedback sentences in
      desired languages.)</p>
