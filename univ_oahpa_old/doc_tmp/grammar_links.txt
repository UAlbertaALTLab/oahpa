# Some notes on grammar links

## Installation

python install.py -i data_sma/meta/grammatikklinker.txt

For now, the process gets the language setting for the link from the URL. I assume that all files will be named including a language code, e.g.: http://victorio.uit.no/some/path/to/verbs.nob.txt

It is possible to include all languages in one file, but it's best to separate them into separate files, e.g., data_sma/meta/grammatikklinker.swe.txt.

When installing the links, the old ones will automatically be deleted and replaced.

## Usage notes

The language displayed will be the same as the user's session language / interface language. If a particular language is not installed, then the default language is nob.

The link list is cached based on session language, because these are unexpected to change, and it's nice to save one database query per view.

Link lists are cached to /var/tmp/smaoahpa_cache

## Troubleshooting

If new languages are implemented and for some reason not showing up, the system will fail silently and display the default language (norwegian), which is defined in conf.context_processors.grammarlinks.

In addition to testing that code, check settings.py, which must have a dictionary of ISO codes.

OLD_NEW_ISO_CODES = {
	"fi": "fin",
	"ru": "rus",
	"en": "eng",
	"no": "nob",
	"de": "deu",
	"sv": "swe",
	"sma": "sma",
}

It is hoped that new, three-character ISO codes will be in use, and thus they will not be translated by smadrill.forms.switch_language_code, but if for some reason the system is still using old ISO codes, and a language that is not in the above list has been installed, it is important to add a translation pair.
