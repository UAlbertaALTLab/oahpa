# TODAY

 * change cache settings for plugin js in nginx configs, some browsers are
   unwilling to get a new version even when it exists.

 * TODO: refresh settings button in plugin
  - run this when the bookmarklet is updated also

 * cakefile include build bookmark.min.js

 * plugin localization: figure out how to serve the right strings
   to external .js service, need to extract specific .po strings 
 
 * lexicon formatters
 
 * mdf
 
 * other dictionaries page, listing links to other groups
 
 * separate group-specific about templates for dictionaries?

 * autocomplete parse only once per file

## post launch TODOs:

 * URLs

    myv, mdf: valks.oahpa.no
    olo, izh, liv: sanat.oahpa.no

    mrh, mrj: muter.oahpa.no
    kpv: kyv.oahpa.no
    yrk: vada.oahpa.no

    prioritet 1: liv<-> fin, myv<->___ 

 * bookmark icon for iOS

    /apple-touch-icon-57x57-precomposed.png
    /apple-touch-icon-57x57.png 
    /apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png 
    /apple-touch-icon.png 

 * svn move to apps/neahttadigisánit, apps/nds

 * certificates, nginx configs?

 * plugin: click save, does not automatically dismiss

 * plugin: IE8 warning popup

 * translate the mobile bookmark bubble, maybe modify/write one for
   android, where the process is a little more complex
 
 * do not analyze if miniparadigm exists, e.g., searching for munnje 
   results in mun, but we only want to see munnje.

 * vise miniparadigmene fra de statiske filene 
   - sjekk at alle pos er med

 * Link til read i selve ordbok-grensesnittet -- kor?
   -- "Vil du ha oversatt ord i en tekst?" 
   -- "Háliidatgo jorgalahttit sániid teavsttas?"
   -- "Haluatko käännöksen tekstissä esiintyvään sanaan?"

 * TODO: go through configuration locations and make sure that all in opt is updated

 * footer links to divvun, oahpa, kursa, giellatekno

 * Tag part translation/localization: v. Ind Prs Pl3 -> definitions in all languages
   - main/gt/common/src/tag-no.regex

 * autocomplete SoMe variant so people don't have to type in whatever, but include multiple options as potential menu selections.

## Next:

 * code for context is in place, just need to go through list of
   contexts and dictionarywork.html to get them all
     
     context="mun"          -- v. prs. s1. - (mun) manan
     context="bivttas"      -- adj. attr.  - alit (bivttas)
     context="gápmagat"     -- num. ??     - guovttit (gápmagat)

 * Tag part translation/localization: v. Ind Prs Pl3 -> definitions in all languages
   - main/gt/common/src/tag-no.regex

 * Glossary page explaining each tag part. 

 * mobile menu language variant display

 * bookmarklet unload on additional click

 * thoughts about detailed entry display: sma shows verb class (I, IV, II), sme
   doesn't, also potentially transitivity. need a place to make it easy to
   format display lang-by-lang
   
 * word test-list - http://giellatekno.uit.no/doc/dicts/checklist.html

 * detailed page needs autocomplete for form

 * dropdown events on mobile are a bit funny for the menu on the
   detailed view, and it is impossible to select a new language pair

 * when to show "more information" link?

 * use logger's own log message formatter

 -- 

 * Version numbers for bookmarklet source, and bookmarklet, need means of
   alerting people to grab a new copy, and what version is in use for debugging.

 * Once all this is together, optimize memory usage, with specific
   attention to gtlab / gtoahpa, may be a better way to have multiple
   threads/greenlets/etc running while parsing trees into only one
   thread.

## Would be nice

 * ping google with sitemap 
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitemaps
    http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=183669

 * Easier means of keeping track of updating FST and lexicon
   dependencies from svn? or at least checking in svn if there are
   updates, not necessarily fetching them

 * advanced search form: here we get to have some nerdy linguistic fun.

## Testing notes for JS click plugin:

 * Firefox error - kapittel 4.1 - skuvla -> skuvlii - works, but there's
   not skuvla

 * opt-doubleclick or opt-select: need to make a note about this


## Testing notes for web interface to VN: 

 * windows, chrome: <-> arrow does not appear on browserstack, probably font
   issue

 * windows, ie8: width of page is kind of funky; responsive doesn't seem to work
   perfectly. maybe can conditionally exclude this for IE8. It's fine in
   IE9, though, but there could be a little more space between the
   analysis div and the word results.

 * iPad - footer is in an odd position

 * A little more padding between analyses when they are collapsed below search
   results, maybe just padding on search results
   

## Features to develop at some point:

 * Use something other than werkzeug's default cache, once things are
   ready for actual use.

 * Maybe should provide an individual process for each language pair?
   Should be easy to split off new processes by pair/endpoint. Note also
   werkzeug DispatcherMiddleware and PathDispatcher:
   http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/appdispatch/

 * added a copy of lookupserv.py, with some tweaks to generalize it for
   any lookup process. This will speed up lookups tons, since the
   slowest part is the process starting up. If each Morphology class had
   its own lookupserv that was automatically launched with the main
   service, things will go a lot faster. It may be there is a better way
   to do subprocesses for an application like this, but for now this
   will work. any improvements will just be drop-in replacements.



### Språkpar:

 * sme<->eng (må lages først i apertiumformat)

 * kom<->eng/fin/rus (words/dicts/kom2X/src + analysator: langs/kpv/)
   - <pos /> element may make some things difficult-- either can include this
     as a possible place to search for pos if <l pos /> isn't set, or wait for
     updated ormat.

 * myv<->fin
   - needs lexicon?
