## Next:

 * code for context is in place, just need to go through list of
   contexts and dictionarywork.html to get them all
     
     context="mun"          -- v. prs. s1. - (mun) manan
     context="bivttas"      -- adj. attr.  - alit (bivttas)
     context="gápmagat"     -- num. ??     - guovttit (gápmagat)

 * Tag part translation/localization: v. Ind Prs Pl3 -> definitions in all languages

 * Glossary page explaining each tag part. 

 * bookmarklet unload on additional click

 * thoughts about detailed entry display: sma shows verb class (I, IV, II), sme
   doesn't, also potentially transitivity. need a place to make it easy to
   format display lang-by-lang
   
 * google analytics

 * facebook modus  -- different fst same dictionary 

 * word test-list - http://giellatekno.uit.no/doc/dicts/checklist.html

 * detailed page needs autocomplete for form

 * dropdown events on mobile are a bit funny for the menu on the
   detailed view, and it is impossible to select a new language pair

 * when to show "more information" link?

 * use logger's own log message formatter

 -- 

 * Once all this is together, optimize memory usage, with specific
   attention to gtlab / gtoahpa, may be a better way to have multiple
   threads/greenlets/etc running while parsing trees into only one
   thread.

## Would be nice

 * Easier means of keeping track of updating FST and lexicon
   dependencies from svn? or at least checking in svn if there are
   updates, not necessarily fetching them

 * advanced search form: here we get to have some nerdy linguistic fun.

## Testing notes for JS click plugin:

 * Firefox error - kapittel 4.1 - skuvla -> skuvlii - works, but there's
   not skuvla

 * opt-doubleclick or opt-select: need to make a note about this


## Testing notes for web interface to VN: 

 * windows, chrome: <-> arrow does not appear on browserstack, probably font
   issue

 * windows, ie8: width of page is kind of funky; responsive doesn't seem to work
   perfectly. maybe can conditionally exclude this for IE8. It's fine in
   IE9, though, but there could be a little more space between the
   analysis div and the word results.

 * iPad - footer is in an odd position

 * A little more padding between analyses when they are collapsed below search
   results, maybe just padding on search results
   

## Features to develop at some point:

 * Use something other than werkzeug's default cache, once things are
   ready for actual use.

 * Maybe should provide an individual process for each language pair?
   Should be easy to split off new processes by pair/endpoint. Note also
   werkzeug DispatcherMiddleware and PathDispatcher:
   http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/appdispatch/

 * added a copy of lookupserv.py, with some tweaks to generalize it for
   any lookup process. This will speed up lookups tons, since the
   slowest part is the process starting up. If each Morphology class had
   its own lookupserv that was automatically launched with the main
   service, things will go a lot faster. It may be there is a better way
   to do subprocesses for an application like this, but for now this
   will work. any improvements will just be drop-in replacements.



### Språkpar:

 * sme<->eng (må lages først i apertiumformat)

 * kom<->eng/fin/rus (words/dicts/kom2X/src + analysator: langs/kpv/)
   - <pos /> element may make some things difficult-- either can include this
     as a possible place to search for pos if <l pos /> isn't set, or wait for
     updated ormat.

 * myv<->fin
   - needs lexicon?
