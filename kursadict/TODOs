Features to develop at some point:

 * Use something other than werkzeug's default cache, once things are
   ready for actual use.

 * lxml loading of trees is slow-- but queries are fast, however
   additional dictionaries slow things down a bit and naturally make one
   process take up more memory. Maybe should provide an individual
   process for each language pair? Should be easy to split off new
   processes by pair/endpoint. Note also werkzeug DispatcherMiddleware
   and PathDispatcher: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/appdispatch/



 * added a copy of lookupserv.py, with some tweaks to generalize it for
   any lookup process. This will speed up lookups tons, since the
   slowest part is the process starting up. If each Morphology class had
   its own lookupserv that was automatically launched with the main
   service, things will go a lot faster. It may be there is a better way
   to do subprocesses for an application like this, but for now this
   will work. any improvements will just be drop-in replacements.
