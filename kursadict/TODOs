Now: 

 * analysis of search word on front page

 * search and autocomplete: bootstrap typeahead

 * form on detail view

 * about page, contact page, plugin page, etc.

 * internationalization, language selection for interface

 * update all names from kursadict to vuosttas neahttasánit in some way,
   maybe 

 * need to figure out how to show links to detailed view from main view
   best, f.eks., in nob->sme there are links to detail for nob, but
   probably we want sma.

 * maybe make it clearer that one can bookmark specific dictionaries,
   e.g. /sme/nob/ or whatever.

 * begin testing for /omg/bbq/ just to make sure there are 404s

 * a little more color?

 * advanced search form: here we get to have some nerdy linguistic fun.

Testing notes:

 * windows, chrome: <-> arrow does not appear on browserstack, probably font
   issue

 * windows, ie8: width of page is kind of funky; responsive doesn't seem to work
   perfectly. maybe can conditionally exclude this for IE8. It's fine in
   IE9, though, but there could be a little more space between the
   analysis div and the word results.

 * iPad - footer is in an odd position


Features to develop at some point:

 * Use something other than werkzeug's default cache, once things are
   ready for actual use.

 * Maybe should provide an individual process for each language pair?
   Should be easy to split off new processes by pair/endpoint. Note also
   werkzeug DispatcherMiddleware and PathDispatcher:
   http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/appdispatch/

 * added a copy of lookupserv.py, with some tweaks to generalize it for
   any lookup process. This will speed up lookups tons, since the
   slowest part is the process starting up. If each Morphology class had
   its own lookupserv that was automatically launched with the main
   service, things will go a lot faster. It may be there is a better way
   to do subprocesses for an application like this, but for now this
   will work. any improvements will just be drop-in replacements.


Server errors: 

 * TEST: G3 generation
