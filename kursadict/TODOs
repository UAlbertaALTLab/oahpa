Now: 

 * index page
 * search and autocomplete
 * direct links to language-pairs


Features to develop at some point:

 * Levenshtein difference for words that don't turn up lexical entries?
   e.g., manna -> mánná 

 * Use something other than werkzeug's default cache, once things are
   ready for actual use.

 * lxml tree parsing and queries are fast enough, maybe occasional slowness 
   is still a memory issue?  Maybe should provide an individual process
   for each language pair? Should be easy to split off new processes by
   pair/endpoint. Note also werkzeug DispatcherMiddleware and
   PathDispatcher: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/appdispatch/


 * added a copy of lookupserv.py, with some tweaks to generalize it for
   any lookup process. This will speed up lookups tons, since the
   slowest part is the process starting up. If each Morphology class had
   its own lookupserv that was automatically launched with the main
   service, things will go a lot faster. It may be there is a better way
   to do subprocesses for an application like this, but for now this
   will work. any improvements will just be drop-in replacements.
