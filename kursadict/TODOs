## Next: 

 * translation strings: there are some small tricky areas, namely translation
   of language names. May need to somehow force these to be included somehow
   if there is no yaml string extractor

   	   http://babel.edgewall.org/wiki/Documentation/setup.html

   maybe need to write custom extractor and yaml flag in config
   	   http://babel.edgewall.org/wiki/Documentation/messages.html
   	   http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation (!!python/unicode, !!python/gettext?)

   custom extractor requires a bit more work than necessary right now, will
   just sneak language names into .po files via .py file instead of .yaml

 * rebuild js to include analyses.

 * báffa - N in FST, pos="a" in lexicon
   vuollásaš - detail, not generating
   http://localhost:5000/detail/sme/nob/vuoll%C3%A1sa%C5%A1.html?no_compounds=true&lemma_match=true&pos_filter=a
  
 * jahkejuvla, jietnadeapmi - missing lexicalized analysis in sme,
   present in lexicon
    - nuoraiddássi
    - ođasvuorká
    - problem only on front page, because detail goes through FST first

 * PoS on <l />
 
 * These all seem to have a similar issue
     TODO: pos="cc" - missing detail
     TODO: pos="cs" - missing detail
     TODO: pos="i" - missing detail
     TODO: pos="n" - mismatch between detail and index, jietnadeapmi
     missing in detail, present in index; index includes search in
     lexicon, detail only goes via lexicon?
     TODO: http://localhost:5000/detail/sme/nob/jahkejuvla.html
 
 * Some other kind of problem:
     TODO: pos="po" - missing in index, check detail
       - lahka does not work
       - luhtte works
       - lusa works
     TODO: pos="pr" - index search, but also detail
       - maŋŋá readings not all present, adv only, has pr and po
     TODO: pos="prop" - prop missing on detail
       - Olgoriikadepartemeanta - missing in detail, also note that s.
       reading does not generate
     TODO: pos="prsprc"
       - badjelgeahčči ? what to relabel this as in user interface


 * boaššohuvvat - missing derived analysis on front page

 * does this work with following proposed change about compound display? 
    mánnageahččijuovlaspábbačiekčangilvvus
    mánnageahčči-juovlaspábbačiekčangilvvus
    boazodoallobearráigeahččispábbačiekčangilvu

 * boazodoallošiehtadallanlávdegoddi

 * group paradigms by lemma to shorten list

 * numbers: generating of compound numbers doesn't work currently, guokte
            works, guoktenuppelohkái doesn't

 * see: email from lene

   * Manglende informasjon for numeraler - legg til paradigme  - ogso sjekk detailed

   * Legge til informasjon om morfologi
   
       Ved å filtrere analysene slik som i forrige sak, så har man god plass i vinduet til å legge til morfologi (plugin-varianten):
   
       boazodoallobearráigehččiid
       N Pl Acc eller N Pl Gen av boazodoallobearráigeahčči (s.) – reindriftsinspektør
   
       !! Context i miniparadigmet
       I adjektiv-fila er det info om context:
       {{{
           <l context="bivttas" pos="a">fiskat</l>
       
           Denne infoen kan brukes slik i miniparadigmet:
           adj. Attr   		alit (bivttas)     <========
           adj. Pl Nom  		alihat
           adj. Comp Attr		alihit
           adj. Comp Sg Nom 	alihit
           adj. Superl Sg Nom	aliheamos
       }}}
   
       Også i numeralfila er det context:
   
       {{{
           <l context="gápmagat" pos="num">guokte</l>
       }}}
   
       Den skal vises for plural-fomen i miniparadigmet:
       guovttit (gápmagat)

   
 * google analytics

 * facebook modus  -- different fst same dictionary 

 * css - ex.) davimus in smenob; padding funny on examples 
 * css - consistency between detailed and list view?

 * word test-list - http://giellatekno.uit.no/doc/dicts/checklist.html

 * fin-sme: multiple words in api, wtf

 * mwe in detailed view
   man láhkái -> 
   http://localhost:5000/detail/fin/sme/mill%C3%A4%20lailla.html?no_compounds=true&lemma_match=true

 * detailed page needs autocomplete for form

 * dropdown events on mobile are a bit funny for the menu on the
   detailed view, and it is impossible to select a new language pair

 * detailed page missing other dictionaries

 * when to show "more information" link?

 * demo image needs to be updated to fix inconsistencies in format

 * eksempelsetningar i lukka ordklasser manglar

 * styling of example sentences on main page needs to be better for wider displays

 * doaimmaheaddjičálus - skilnad mellom detail view og list view

 * use logger's own log message formatter

 -- 

 * http://packages.python.org/Flask-Babel/
   * nøkkelformer

 * styling of language select-- flags, or not?

 * about page, contact page, plugin page, etc.

 * update all names from kursadict to neahttadigisánit in some way,
   maybe 

 * maybe make it clearer that one can bookmark specific dictionaries,
   e.g. /sme/nob/ or whatever.

 * Once all this is together, optimize memory usage, with specific
   attention to gtlab / gtoahpa, may be a better way to have multiple
   threads/greenlets/etc running while parsing trees into only one
   thread.

## Would be nice

 * Easier means of keeping track of updating FST and lexicon
   dependencies from svn? or at least checking in svn if there are
   updates, not necessarily fetching them

 * ordering of results on front page if a word is not found in the
   lexicon -- maybe just include these in the analysis block only?

 * advanced search form: here we get to have some nerdy linguistic fun.

## Testing notes for JS click plugin:

 * Firefox error - kapittel 4.1 - skuvla -> skuvlii - works, but there's
   not skuvla

 * opt-doubleclick or opt-select: need to make a note about this


## Testing notes for web interface to VN: 

 * windows, chrome: <-> arrow does not appear on browserstack, probably font
   issue

 * windows, ie8: width of page is kind of funky; responsive doesn't seem to work
   perfectly. maybe can conditionally exclude this for IE8. It's fine in
   IE9, though, but there could be a little more space between the
   analysis div and the word results.

 * iPad - footer is in an odd position

 * A little more padding between analyses when they are collapsed below search
   results, maybe just padding on search results
   

## Features to develop at some point:

 * Use something other than werkzeug's default cache, once things are
   ready for actual use.

 * Maybe should provide an individual process for each language pair?
   Should be easy to split off new processes by pair/endpoint. Note also
   werkzeug DispatcherMiddleware and PathDispatcher:
   http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/appdispatch/

 * added a copy of lookupserv.py, with some tweaks to generalize it for
   any lookup process. This will speed up lookups tons, since the
   slowest part is the process starting up. If each Morphology class had
   its own lookupserv that was automatically launched with the main
   service, things will go a lot faster. It may be there is a better way
   to do subprocesses for an application like this, but for now this
   will work. any improvements will just be drop-in replacements.


## Server errors: 

 * TEST: G3 generation


## Priorities

 1. implementer plugin i kursa
 2. url-basert  sti for å installera heller iframe eller noko anna via proxy
 3. plugin for forskjellige nettlesere: chrome, firefox
 4. forsida som macdict

### Språkpar:

 * sme<->nob
 * sme<->fin 
 * sma<->nob (NB: eigen FST til sma-ordboka)
 * sme<->eng (må lages først i apertiumformat)

For these the formatting isn't quite right, so that collect-dict-parts.xsl
won't produce anything.

 * kom<->eng/fin/rus (words/dicts/kom2X/src + analysator: langs/kpv/
 * myv<->fin
