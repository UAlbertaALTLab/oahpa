Switch to the NDS user account.

Note that when logged in as the NDS user, the python virtualenv should be loaded automatically, and you will see this before the command prompt: (neahtta_env)[neahtta@gtoahpa ~]$

As NDS user: 

 * cd ~/gtsvn/ ; svn up words
 * cd ~/kursadict/dicts/ ; sh make_dict.sh
 * check that there were no errors, also wc -l *.xml to make sure there is content

Also, sometimes it's a good idea to run the interactive shell with the app, just to make sure that all of the files are able to be parsed with no errors before restarting the actual production service: 

 * cd ~/kursadict/ ; python manage.py shell

If everything is good and there are no errors, you'll see the command prompt. Exit, and restart the service (as another user):  

  sudo service neahttadigisanit stop
  sudo service neahttadigisanit start

The reason this is done in two separate steps is just to make
sure everything has come down before starting it up again. Usually advisable to watch `top`.
