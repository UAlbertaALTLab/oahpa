# TODO: oahpa or wordpress are doing weird things with usernames in WP, which get set to a url.
#       need to fix this 

# TODO: make a shorter URL that is easier for users, or create a separate
# django service that has access to database tables to check for user
# permissions

# TODO: make the permission check templates prettier / CSS

# TODO: is there some way to automatically fill in the login url on WP so users
# don't have to type it in when they arrive on that page after coming directly
# from Oahpa?

# TODO: Course page needs to be adjusted to show user what their login URL is.

    # You are a member in a course
    #  * Course link
    #  * Copy and paste this URL if you are asked to log in:
