The Vasta demo
==============

First: compile the eng.fst:

cd englexc
make

You can test different translations. You do three commands:

echo 'This is a shoe' | preprocess | $LOOKUP ../englexc/eng.fst | lookup2cg > engtest

echo 'maskisin Ã´ma' | preprocess | $LOOKUP $GTHOME/langs/crk/src/analyser-gt-desc.xfst | lookup2cg >  crktest

sh cg3_check.sh





Sentence patters (no punctuation!):
* This/that is a shoe
* These/those are cats
* This/that shoe
* These/those cats

shoe
knife
spoon
bread
sugar
