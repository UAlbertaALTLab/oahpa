#> ----------------------- REVIEW -------------------- 
#> 
#> The paper presents an interactive CALL program for North Sami using 
#> the latest version of the vislcg compiler. The paper contains some 
#> interesting ideas but no motivation, apart from the authors own 
#> inspiration, and no evaluation with actual users. Thus, there is 
#> no evidence that the approach will work. I believe it could be 
#> expected from a paper of this kind to give some motivation from 
#> the CALL literature including other CALL programs developed with 
#> the VISL tools. 
___TODO___
Needed to address is the following:
- Call literature
tt: Still largely not done.
tt: Now read and read literature. I still have not found reference
tt: to working systems, but somehow hesitate wrinting it.
- evaluation of log (the game works)
tt: Wrote a chapter on evaluation
- evaluation with actual users -->
tt: This we have not done. Did perhaps write a note on this.
- Otherwise I am not so convinced by the reviewer: What does s/he miss?
I posted a query on literature to the Corpora list, and got no relevant answers.

#> In particular I am not sure that the idea of designing the pedagogical 
#> programs as additions within the visl analyzers is a good idea. While 
#> the ambition to handle relatively free input from learners is 
#> noteworthy, thus making a powerful analyser a necessity, the requirements 
#> of a program for language teaching and learning are not specified, 
#> so it is hard to know whether they can be met by the proposed 
#> approach. 
tt:
This is a valid point. The requirements are:
- able to reliably analyse input
- able to detect errors
- vislcg3 fulfils both these goals.

#> But modularity is usually a good strategy. And, since no 
#> evaluation 
#> is presented, the success of the approach cannot be estimated either. 

What is needed here is a Sahka log. To bad it was not installed from the 
beginning. Our experience is that 
- the visl analyser is a good idea
- no other analyser would have been a good idea. 
This we'd better state. (politeness and ignorance prohibits the second point, 
but the first is in the conclusion.


#> The paper would gain much from relating itself to current research 
#> in the CALL field, in particular CALL with NLP-modules. 
tt: Nothing convincing so far. I thus simply do not agree with the reviewer.
#> There are a number of typos, e.g. The dialogue gama (4.2 header), 
fixed. tt.
#> 'each scenario has are underlying' (4.2 second paragraph). 
fixed.tt.

#> 
#> The paper presents a CALL tool for North Sami. The programme uses existing 
#> language resources - a finite-state transducer for morphological 
#> analysis/generation and a constraint grammar parser for morphological 
#> disambiguation /syntactic analysis. A user can easily access the system 
#> and get flexible feedback about errors. A question answering game is 
#> included. 

#> Some remarks: 
#> The introduction of the article should be expanded, the background and 
#> comparison with other CALL tools would be useful. 
tt: half a page for this is free. Now hopefully better.
#> The title is '... programs ...' but you talk about a 'program' in the 
Fixed. tt.

#> Spelling should be checked.

#> ----------------------- REVIEW -------------------- 
#> 
#> The paper presents an interactive pedagogical suite of programs for North 
#> Sámi, which is based on finite state transducers and a constraint grammar 
#> analyser. The modules of these programs include lexicon, sentence 
#> generator, system for dialectical variation, system for feedback on 
#> morphology, syntactic analyser of the student's answer. 
#> 
#> The pedagogical programs in the suite are three: open question-answering 
#> game, dialogue game and web interface. 
#> 
#> In my opinion, the work presented in the paper is interesting and thus it 
#> should be accepted after the authors have make the corrections noted 
#> below, which will improve clarity. Also, the section on References it too 
#> short considering that there is a lot of free space. More references 
#> should be included in the final version of the paper. 
#> 
#> p. 1, Abstract: 
#> 
#> what does 'CALL program' stand for? 
Explained, albeit the result is far from elegant. tt.

#> what is 'North Sámi'? After going into the paper, the reader knows that it 
#> is a language, but this should be clarified right from the start. 
Sigh. Again, explained. tt.

#> p.1, Introduction, at the end: 
#> The paper says that he final section presents an evaluation. Where is this 
#> section concerned with the evaluation? The last section presents the 
#> conclusions, and nothing seems to be said there about evaluation. 
___TODO___
This we must look into.
tt: Done.


#> p. 4, top: 
#> Section 3 describes the modules of the pedagogical programs. Hence, the 
#> title of Section 3.5 should be changed, e.g., to "3.5 Syntactic analyser 
#> of the student's answer" 
Done. tt.

#> Typo 
#> p. 1, Introduction: 
#> "The final section present an evaluation" -#>  "The final section presents 
#> an evaluation" 
Fixed tt.

#> p. 7 
#> "4.2 The dialogue gama" -#> "4.2 The dialogue game" 
Fixed tt.
