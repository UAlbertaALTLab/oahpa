> 
> The paper presents an interactive CALL program for North Sami using 
> the latest version of the vislcg compiler. The paper contains some 
> interesting ideas but no motivation, apart from the authors own 
> inspiration, and no evaluation with actual users. Thus, there is 
> no evidence that the approach will work. I believe it could be 
> expected from a paper of this kind to give some motivation from 
> the CALL literature including other CALL programs developed with 
> the VISL tools. 
> In particular I am not sure that the idea of designing the pedagogical 
> programs as additions within the visl analyzers is a good idea. While 
> the ambition to handle relatively free input from learners is 
> noteworthy, thus making a powerful analyser a necessity, the requirements 
> of a program for language teaching and learning are not specified, 
> so it is hard to know whether they can be met by the proposed 
> approach. But modularity is usually a good strategy. And, since no 
> evaluation 
> is presented, the success of the approach cannot be estimated either. 
> The paper would gain much from relating itself to current research 
> in the CALL field, in particular CALL with NLP-modules. 
> There are a number of typos, e.g. The dialogue gama (4.2 header), 
> 'each scenario has are underlying' (4.2 second paragraph).

> The paper presents an interactive pedagogical suite of programs for North 
> Sámi, which is based on finite state transducers and a constraint grammar 
> analyser. The modules of these programs include lexicon, sentence 
> generator, system for dialectical variation, system for feedback on 
> morphology, syntactic analyser of the student's answer. 
> 
> The pedagogical programs in the suite are three: open question-answering 
> game, dialogue game and web interface. 
> 
> In my opinion, the work presented in the paper is interesting and thus it 
> should be accepted after the authors have make the corrections noted 
> below, which will improve clarity. Also, the section on References it too 
> short considering that there is a lot of free space. More references 
> should be included in the final version of the paper.

> what does 'CALL program' stand for? 
> 
> what is 'North Sámi'? After going into the paper, the reader knows that it 
> is a language, but this should be clarified right from the start.

> p.1, Introduction, at the end: 
> 
> The paper says that he final section presents an evaluation. Where is this 
> section concerned with the evaluation? The last section presents the 
> conclusions, and nothing seems to be said there about evaluation. 
> 
> p. 4, top: 
> 
> Section 3 describes the modules of the pedagogical programs. Hence, the
